# The Price of Shared Pointers

### Nicolai Josuttis "The Price of Shared Pointers or Why Passing them by-reference can be Useful" (May 2015)

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drhIIbmrjzg)

* `make_shared` and `weak_ptr`: potential memory overhead
* `enable_shared_from_this`
* `atomic_shared_ptr` removed from C++11
* _MESI_ cache management protocol: Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid
* [GotW 91](https://herbsutter.com/2013/06/05/gotw-91-solution-smart-pointer-parameters/)

# Stringify

A single-header-file library to pretty-print STL containers (implicitly GPL)

[GitHub](https://github.com/asit-dhal/stringify)

Based on [printers](https://github.com/mnciitbhu/printers) (GPL)

# llvm::Expected

* [GitHub](https://github.com/weliveindetail/llvm-expected) (LLVM licence)
* [Video (5m)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq8fNK98WGw)
* [Article 1: Basics](https://weliveindetail.github.io/blog/post/2017/09/06/llvm-expected-basics.html)
* [Article 2: Differentiation](https://weliveindetail.github.io/blog/post/2017/09/07/llvm-expected-differentiation.html)
* Uses `llvm::ErrorInfo` instead of a template parameter error type
* Article 3: coming soon

# liberasure

[GitHub](https://github.com/atomgalaxy/liberasure)

A no-dependencies C++ extensible type erasure library + lecture material.

# static_any: a low-latency stack-based Boost.Any

[Article](http://david-grs.github.io/low_latency_stack_based_boost_any/), [GitHub](https://github.com/david-grs/static_any) (MIT)

A container for generic (as general) data type like `boost.any`. However:

* It is ~10x faster than `boost.any`, mainly because there is no memory allocation
* As it lies on the stack, it is cache-friendly, close to your other class attributes
* There is a very small space overhead: a fixed overhead of 8 bytes

# "Virtual concepts"

* [Concept-Model Idiom Part One: A new look at polymorphism](https://gracicot.github.io/conceptmodel/2017/09/13/concept-model-part1.html), [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/709ttn/conceptmodel_idiom_part_one_a_new_look_at/)
* Virtual Concepts ([GitHub](https://github.com/andyprowl/virtual-concepts)): A research project aimed at introducing language support for type erasure in C++, [std-proposals discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!msg/std-proposals/4gEt2OBbSQM/dFr3Go95iZgJ) (Andy Prowl, with feedback from Brittany Friedman, whom he keeps calling "Brent")

# Ericsson's CodeCompass

Open-source C, C++ and Java code navigator based on Clang/LLVM: [GitHub](https://github.com/Ericsson/CodeCompass), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjQG3RNfFxM), [PDF](http://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-03//assets/slides/code_compass_an_open_software_comprehension_framework.pdf)

# Expression Template Library (ETL) 1.2

ETL is a header only library for C++ that provides vector and matrix classes with support for Expression Templates to perform very efficient operations on them.

At this time, the library support compile-time sized matrix and vector and runtime-sized matrix and vector with all element-wise operations implemented. It also supports 1D and 2D convolution, matrix multiplication (naive algorithm and Strassen) and FFT.

# Orbit Profiler

Orbit is a standalone profiler and debugging tool for Windows. Its main purpose is to help developers understand and visualize the execution flow of a complex application. By giving a birdâ€™s eye view of what is happening under the hood, Orbit gives the developer a deeper understanding of complex systems and allows to quickly find performance bottlenecks.
