# CppCon 2017: Titus Winters "C++ as a 'Live at Head' Language"

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tISy7EJQPzI)

* Software engineering is about resilience to change over time.
* Semantic versioning (SemVer): x.y.z
* As C++ code is distributed in source form, we should live at head.

Hyrum's Law:

> With a sufficient number of users of an API, it doesn't matter what you promise in the contract, all observable behaviours of your system will be depended on by somebody.

# Why is the `std::function` `operator()` `const`?

# Apple open-sourced the Darwin kernel (XNU)

[GitHub](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu)

XNU kernel is part of the Darwin operating system for use in OS X and iOS operating systems. XNU is an acronym for XNU is Not Unix. XNU is a hybrid kernel combining the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University with components from FreeBSD and C++ API for writing drivers called IOKit. XNU runs on I386, X86_64 for both single processor and multi-processor configurations.

# ComputeCpp for Windows

[CodePlay announcement](https://codeplay.com/portal/09-27-17-computecpp-windows-support)

ComputeCpp Community Edition is now available on Windows. This means it is now possible to develop [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl) applications using Windows and Visual Studio.

SYCL (pronounced ‘sickle’) is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that builds on the underlying concepts, portability and efficiency of OpenCL that enables code for heterogeneous processors to be written in a “single-source” style using completely standard C++.

# The Price of Shared Pointers

[Nicolai Josuttis "The Price of Shared Pointers or Why Passing them by-reference can be Useful" (May 2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drhIIbmrjzg)

* `make_shared` and `weak_ptr`: potential memory overhead
* `enable_shared_from_this`
* `atomic_shared_ptr` removed from C++11
* _MESI_ cache management protocol: Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid
* [GotW 91](https://herbsutter.com/2013/06/05/gotw-91-solution-smart-pointer-parameters/)
* Audience didn't agree with the presenter (quite rightly)

# Stringify

A single-header-file library to pretty-print STL containers (implicitly GPL)

[GitHub](https://github.com/asit-dhal/stringify)

Based on [printers](https://github.com/mnciitbhu/printers) (GPL)

# llvm::Expected

* [Video (5m)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq8fNK98WGw)
* [Article 1: Basics](https://weliveindetail.github.io/blog/post/2017/09/06/llvm-expected-basics.html)
* [Article 2: Differentiation](https://weliveindetail.github.io/blog/post/2017/09/07/llvm-expected-differentiation.html)
* Uses `llvm::ErrorInfo` instead of a template parameter error type
* Unchecked `llvm::Error` objects abort program on destruction

# liberasure

[GitHub](https://github.com/atomgalaxy/liberasure)

A no-dependencies C++ extensible type erasure library + lecture material.

# static_any: a low-latency stack-based Boost.Any

* [Article](http://david-grs.github.io/low_latency_stack_based_boost_any/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/david-grs/static_any) (MIT)

A container for generic (as general) data type like `boost.any`. However:

* It is ~10x faster than `boost.any`, mainly because there is no memory allocation
* As it lies on the stack, it is cache-friendly, close to your other class attributes
* There is a very small space overhead: a fixed overhead of 8 bytes

# Expression Template Library (ETL) 1.2

ETL is a header only library for C++ that provides vector and matrix classes with support for Expression Templates to perform very efficient operations on them.

At this time, the library support compile-time sized matrix and vector and runtime-sized matrix and vector with all element-wise operations implemented. It also supports 1D and 2D convolution, matrix multiplication (naive algorithm and Strassen) and FFT.

# Orbit Profiler

Orbit is a standalone profiler and debugging tool for Windows. Its main purpose is to help developers understand and visualize the execution flow of a complex application. By giving a bird’s eye view of what is happening under the hood, Orbit gives the developer a deeper understanding of complex systems and allows to quickly find performance bottlenecks.

# C++17 class template argument deduction

[Article by Arne Mertz](https://arne-mertz.de/2017/06/class-template-argument-deduction/)

Before C++17:

```cpp
std::pair<int, double> myPair1(22, 43.9);
auto myPair2 = std::make_pair(22, 43.9);
```

Since C++17:

```cpp
std::pair myPair{22, 43.9};
```

Deduction guide:

```cpp
namespace std {
    template<class T1, class T2>
    pair(T1 const&, T2 const&) -> pair<T1, T2>;
}
```
