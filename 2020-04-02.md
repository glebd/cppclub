> I personally believe that C++20 is the most important update of the standard in this language’s history.

## Include guards vs. #pragma once (1/2)

* [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/once?view=vs-2019)

We recommend the `#pragma once` directive for new code because it doesn't pollute the global namespace with a preprocessor symbol. It requires less typing, is less distracting, and can't cause symbol collisions, errors caused when different header files use the same preprocessor symbol as the guard value.

* [CppReference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/impl)

Unlike header guards, this pragma makes it impossible to erroneously use the same macro name in more than one file. OTOH, since with `#pragma once` files are excluded based on their filesystem-level identity, this can't protect against including a header twice if it exists in more than one location in a project.

## Include guards vs. #pragma once (2/2)

* [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#note-340)

Some implementations offer vendor extensions like `#pragma once` as alternative to include guards. It is not standard and it is not portable. It injects the hosting machine's filesystem semantics into your program, in addition to locking you down to a vendor. Our recommendation is to write in ISO C++.

## Why so many people hate C++?

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fm5h6r/why_so_many_people_hate_c/)

> C++ gets a lot of hate because there are many really bad C++ programmers that think they're good and we're still cleaning up their messes. It's given the illusion that the language is bad because it allows them to do this.

## "Making new friends" idiom by Dan Saks

[Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Making_New_Friends)

> The goal is to simplify creation of friend functions for a class template.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
template<typename T>
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T& t) { value = t; }
   friend std::ostream& operator <<(std::ostream& os, const Foo<T>& b)
   {
      return os << b.value;
   }
};
