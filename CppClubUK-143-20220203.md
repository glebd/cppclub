## Why do you like C++?

An amusing [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/scri8u/why_do_you_like_c/) on Reddit.

Some replies:

## `const` all the things?

Arthur O'Dwyer wrote [this article](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/23/dont-const-all-the-things/) on his blog. In it he lists places where he uses `const` and where he doesn't:

Const:

> In function signatures: passing by `const` reference, `const` member functions

No const:

> In function signatures: passing by value
> Data members: never `const`
> > <...> the point of making a class with private members is to preserve invariants among those members. “This never changes” is just one possible invariant. Some people hear “never changes” and think it sounds a bit like `const`, so they slap const on that data member; but you shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that the way we preserve invariants in C++ isn’t with `const`, it’s with `private`.
> Return types: never `const`

Rarely `const`:

> Local variables (_I tend to disagree_)

[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/sbcjek/const_all_the_things/). A few redditors think that locals should be as `const` as possible.

This is [another Reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/s823vk/declaring_all_variables_local_to_a_function_as/) on making local variables `const`, and most commenters there agree with that.
