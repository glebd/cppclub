# ULID: Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier

* [GitHub](https://github.com/alizain/ulid)
* [C++](https://github.com/suyash/ulid) --- header-only, MIT
* 128-bit compatibility with UUID
* 1.21e+24 unique ULIDs per millisecond
* Lexicographically sortable!
* Canonically encoded as a 26 character string, as opposed to the 36 character UUID
* Uses Crockford's *base32* for better efficiency and readability (5 bits per character)
* Case insensitive
* No special characters (URL safe)
* Monotonic sort order (correctly detects and handles the same millisecond)

# Does C++ need a universal package manager?

* [Article by Paul Fultz II](http://pfultz2.com/blog/2017/10/27/universal-package-manager/)
* [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/79a0x3/does_c_need_a_universal_package_manager/)
* [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15578065)
* Many package managers but no standard build system for C++
* A platform independent package manager for C++ must effectively degrade into a build system that rebuilds all dependencies from source (Rust & Cargo)

> What C++ needs is a common format to communicate a package’s requirements among different package manager tools.

# Conan 0.28.1

[Changelog](http://docs.conan.io/en/latest/changelog.html)

# Transwarp

*Transwarp* is a header-only C++ library for task concurrency. It enables you to free your functors from explicit threads and transparently manage dependencies. Under the hood, a directed acyclic graph is built that allows for efficient traversal and type-safe dependencies. Use *transwarp* if you want to model your dependent operations in a graph of tasks and intend to invoke the graph more than once (MIT).

# Ctla: Compile-time linear algebra in C++

[GitHub](https://github.com/moroneyt/ctla) (MIT)

* Header-only library
* All functions `constexpr`, all computation done at compile time
* Intuitive syntax for initialisation, indexing, augmenting
* Matrix arithmetic including inverses and linear systems supported
* Block matrices supported
* Runtime printing in MATLAB-compatible syntax if required

# Pacific++ Conference in New Zealand

* [Pacific++ Conference Website](https://pacificplusplus.com/) (Christchurch, New Zealand)

# CppCon 2017: Barbara Geller & Ansel Sermersheim "Unicode Strings: Why the Implementation Matters"

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysh2B6ZgNXk)

* Unicode introduction
* You cannot interpret a sequence of characters without knowing the encoding
* `std::string` or `std::wstring` have no way to specify encoding
* MFC, Java, C#, QT: UCS-2, UTF-16
* .NET `TextField` length is specified in storage units => can crash .NET runtime

# CsString

A library providing Unicode-aware string support for C++. Part of [CopperSpice](https://github.com/copperspice)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/copperspice/cs_string) (BSD 2-clause)
* [Docs](http://www.copperspice.com/docs/cs_string/namespace_cs_string.html)
* Header-only, C++11

> Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.

# "Making new friends" idiom by Dan Saks

[Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Making_New_Friends)

> The goal is to simplify creation of friend functions for a class template.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T& t) { value = t; }
   friend ostream& operator <<(ostream& os, const Foo<T>& b)
   {
      return os << b.value;
   }
};
```
