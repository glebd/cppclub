# Follow-up: Aggregates

From [CppReference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization): An aggregate is one of the following types:

* array type
* class type (typically, `struct` or `union`), that has
  * no private or protected *direct* (since C++17) non-static data members
  * no *user-declared constructors* (until C++11)
  * no *user-provided constructors* (explicitly defaulted or deleted constructors are allowed) (since C++11) (until C++17)
  * no *user-provided, inherited, or explicit constructors* (explicitly defaulted or deleted constructors are allowed) (since C++17) (until C++20)
  * no *user-declared or inherited constructors* (since C++20)
  * no virtual, private, or *protected* (since C++17) base classes
  * no virtual member functions
  * no *default member initializers* (since C++11) (until C++14)

# "Making new friends" idiom by Dan Saks

[Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Making_New_Friends)

> The goal is to simplify creation of friend functions for a class template.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T& t) { value = t; }
   friend ostream& operator <<(ostream& os, const Foo<T>& b)
   {
      return os << b.value;
   }
};
```

# A new decade, a new tool: **libman**

* [Colby Pike (vector-of-bool)](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2020/01/06/new-decade.html)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ekwb4y/a_new_decade_a_new_tool/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/libman)
* [Specification](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/?force=1&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vector-of-bool/libman/develop/data/spec.bs)

**libman** is a new level of indirection between package management and build systems.

**dds** is Drop-Dead Simple build and package manager.
