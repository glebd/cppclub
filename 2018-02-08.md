# Simon Brand's C++ tips on Twitter

Fact:

```cpp
struct a { void foo(); };
struct b : a{};
void b::b::b::b::b::b::a::foo(){}
```

That is valid code due to the "injected type name".

# Simon Brand's C++ tips on Twitter (cont.)

Prefer templates or function_ref types to `std::function` when you don't need to own arbitrary callables. You pay for the flexibility `std::function` gives you.

# Simon Brand's C++ tips on Twitter (cont.)

If you are careful `std::shared_ptr<base>` can capture the correct deleter for `derived` even if there's no virtual destructor because it type-erases the deleter on construction.

# Simon Brand's C++ tips on Twitter (cont.)

C++ is not a strict superset of C. There is no such language as C/C++.

# Simon Brand's C++ tips on Twitter (cont.)

Some parts of C++ are hard for everyone and we all make mistakes.

* MSVC emits messages from the backend instead of frontend. This means that the warnings you get depend on the optimisation level.
* UB allows the compiler to optimise away code that should not be
* Has there been a case of defining a previously UB?

# Outcome accepted into Boost

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/7vdpyu/outcome_accepted_into_the_boost_c_libraries/)

> Outcome is really an abstraction layer for setting per-namespace rules for when to throw exceptions. Exception throwing is absolutely at the heart of Outcome. That's why Outcome != Expected, and why it ICEs older compilers, and why C++14 is needed.

> Error handling can be done with exceptions, or with branch-testing on error instances; and some algorithms or constraints may favor one over the other for technical or compositional reasons.

> The core of the dispute seems to be over the value of localized reasoning for handling errors: Exceptions are good for “distant” handling (to seamlessly transfer handling to a parent context), while explicit error/result instances (possibly customized) encourage local reasoning for discrete handling within the local algorithm context.
