# Outcome accepted into Boost

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/7vdpyu/outcome_accepted_into_the_boost_c_libraries/)

> Outcome is really an abstraction layer for setting per-namespace rules for when to throw exceptions. Exception throwing is absolutely at the heart of Outcome. That's why Outcome != Expected, and why it ICEs older compilers, and why C++14 is needed.

> Error handling can be done with exceptions, or with branch-testing on error instances; and some algorithms or constraints may favor one over the other for technical or compositional reasons.

> The core of the dispute seems to be over the value of localized reasoning for handling errors: Exceptions are good for “distant” handling (to seamlessly transfer handling to a parent context), while explicit error/result instances (possibly customized) encourage local reasoning for discrete handling within the local algorithm context.
