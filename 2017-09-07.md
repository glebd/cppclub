# Buckaroo

* [Home](http://buckaroo.pm) :: [Version 1.3](https://hackernoon.com/highlights-of-buckaroo-1-3-adf74b1b4aea)
* [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/69fkeb/buckaroo_cc_package_manager/)
* Advantages over Conan
  * Reproducibility, since the dependency graph is tracked via Git and file hashes
  * No requirements to run a server, since everything is a file
  * Faster builds using [Buck](https://buckbuild.com)
* Both Buck and Buckaroo depend on Java (!)
