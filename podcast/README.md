# The C++ Club Podcast

## Intro

Hello, my name is Gleb, I live in London, and I run a C++ study group at work. In our weekly meetings I talk about C++ news and anything related to C++. You can find our meeting notes at cppclub.uk. This podcast and the meeting notes contain public information only, and are not related to my employer in any way.
