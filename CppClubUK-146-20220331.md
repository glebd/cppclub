## Minimum viable declarative GUI in C++

Jean-MichaÃ«l Celerier wrote an [article](https://ossia.io/posts/minimum-viable/) that introduces a minimal declarative C++ GUI library. Like, really minimal, where declaring a struct is enough to define a user interface. Later this declaration is included in another 'magical' file which produces the declared UI. The resulting interface can be rendered by Qt via QML or another backend, like [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) (a C-based immediate mode UI engine).

An example UI declaration is on [GitHub](https://github.com/celtera/avendish/blob/main/examples/Ui.hpp).
