Eric Niebler on Executors
=========================

`Corentin <https://twitter.com/Cor3ntin/status/1186040861626437632>`_: Executors are the least
useful part of "A Unified Executors Proposal"

`Eric Niebler <https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/1186343156326887425>`_:

It makes me happy to see the power of the Scheduler/Sender/Receiver recognized.

Much of traditional Rx assumes runtime polymorphism and garbage collection / ref counting. That's
obviously a poor fit for C++. The sender/receiver design skews toward static polymorphism w/Generic
interfaces, and explicit memory mgmt.

Eric Niebler on Executors (cont.)
=================================

The factoring of `submit` into `connect`/`start` gives more flexible ownership semantics, and aligns
the design conceptually with coroutines, making coroutines an efficient way of expressing
sender/receiver.

Once you introduce concurrency with non-overlapping scopes, the lifetime of your async operation
state no longer corresponds to a simple C++ scope. That's why explicit memory mgmt and ownership
become issues where they wouldn't be otherwise.

Eric Niebler on Executors (cont.)
=================================

One of coroutines great strengths is that they let us map async lifetime back to C++ scopes. Under
the hood, the coroutine is carved up into callbacks, and the operation state (coroutine frame) is
getting managed explicitly, but all that gets hidden from you by the coro types.

Sender/receiver is a library reification of this separation. You might argue (and some have) that we
should just drop sender/receiver and use coroutines everywhere for everything "async". That's
appealing, but goes too far. Coroutines, for all their value, come up short sometimes.

Eric Niebler on Executors (cont.)
=================================

C++ has a long sad history of giving old things new names. Map and fold would have been better than
transform and accumulate, and don't get me started on vector. Sender/receiver share some pedigree
with Observable/Observer, but they really are different beasts ... by necessity.

The intended purpose of sender/receiver is to be a base lingua franca for all C++ async libraries. I
expect end-users to interface at much higher levels of abstraction in their own code.
