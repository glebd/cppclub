> I guess most of you know who Dave Abrahams is and what he has done in the C++ community. He
> switched gears a little and is now working at Apple focusing mostly on the development of the
> Swift language and its library. However, yesterday he gave an excellent talk at their Developer
> Conference entitled Embracing Algorithms, which IMHO is general enough to be of interest for C++
> developers as well. The link has a video of that 40 minutes long talk as well as the slides.
