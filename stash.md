> I guess most of you know who Dave Abrahams is and what he has done in the C++ community. He
> switched gears a little and is now working at Apple focusing mostly on the development of the
> Swift language and its library. However, yesterday he gave an excellent talk at their Developer
> Conference entitled Embracing Algorithms, which IMHO is general enough to be of interest for C++
> developers as well. The link has a video of that 40 minutes long talk as well as the slides.

### CoSy - Computing Systems Technology Conference

* [Website](https://soasis.org/cosy/)

CoSy (pronounced like "cozy") is a Systems Programming Conference open to developers from all walks of life, both professional and non-professional, who want to engage other like-minded individuals for an intimate and wonderful blend of content.

* Broad scope (C++, C, Rust, Zig, FORTH, Nim, OCaml etc.)
* Double-blinded submission reviews

> Of course, it’s not always possible to double-blind everything! If someone writes a submission about how they wrote a Great Book On Large Scale Software Architecture That’s Really Good And Helps You Modularize And Structure Large Software And The Sequel Is Out You Should Buy It Now, they have vastly reduced the pool of people they could be talking about.
