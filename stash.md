# "Making new friends" idiom by Dan Saks

[Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Making_New_Friends)

> The goal is to simplify creation of friend functions for a class template.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T& t) { value = t; }
   friend ostream& operator <<(ostream& os, const Foo<T>& b)
   {
      return os << b.value;
   }
};
```

# True parallelism, with no concept of threads - Alfred Bratterud - Meeting C++ 2017

Fibers, green threads, channels, lightweight processes, coroutines, pthreads - there are lots of options for parallelism abstractions. But what do you do if you just want your application to run a specific task on a specific core on your machine? In IncludeOS we have proper multicore support allowing you to do just that in C++: assign a task - for instance a lambda - directly to an available CPU. <...> In this talk weâ€™ll <...> explore how direct per-core processing can be combined with threading concepts like C++14 fibers or coroutines, without taking away from the simplicity of getting work done uninterrupted.

# True parallelism, with no concept of threads - Alfred Bratterud - Meeting C++ 2017 (cont.)

Conclusions:

* You don't need classical threads to utilize CPU cores
    * Fibers and coroutines can run directly on them
* A pthreads backend requires true blocking
    * Might require fibers, yielding directly to scheduler
* Coroutines TS beats the simplest stack switch
* Stackful coroutines would replace our fibers
* Expect more multicore magic from IncludeOS

* [Video: Systematic Generation of Data and Types in C++](https://vimeo.com/247642986) -- this talk presents two classic techniques from the functional domain -- composable data generators and property-based testing -- implemented in C++14 for testing a generic serialization and deserialization library ([RefleX](http://rticommunity.github.io/rticonnextdds-reflex/)). The talk describes the laws of monoids, functors, applicative, and monads and how they are implemented in a simple to understand abstraction of data generators.

**Example tasks**: Create a tuple from a list of types and then transform it into a variant; Look for the presence of a type in a tuple and get its index; Sort a list of types; Advanced static assertion with arithmetics and complex functions; Go through a list of types and perform a runtime action for each type.

* is a good language but the community is toxic towards people not using Rust
* lacks function overloading, value generics, variadic generics and exceptions
* is much nicer, though I doubt I'll get to use it in my current job any time soon
* solves a non-problem if you use modern C++
* is a topic way too often spawning on this C++ subreddit
* would have been a compelling alternative if it came out 10 years ago
* lacks library support
* less powerful but more user-friendly than C++
