## Bitpacker

[GitHub](https://github.com/CrustyAuklet/bitpacker) (Header only, Boost license, C++14/C++17/C++20)

A library to do type-safe and low-boilerplate bit level serialization, binary-compatible with Python [bitstruct](https://pypi.org/project/bitstruct/) module. This is useful for embedded projects where bit-level encoding is needed so it's not possible to use other serialization libraries like [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/), [ProtoBuffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), or [Cereal](https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/).

Note that the library doesn't currently support floating point values. To define serialization format, the library uses a DSL, something akin to `printf`.

```cpp
std::array<uint8_t, 7> make_message_py(const MessageData& data) {
    return bitpacker::pack(BP_STRING("u12b1b1u14s24"),
                data.voltage,
                data.error,
                data.other,
                data.pressure,
                data.time);
```

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/n2v0vu/bitpacker_type_safe_and_lowboilerplate_bit_level/) points to another similar library: [CAN-Helpers](https://github.com/Wetmelon/CAN-Helpers), which makes it easier to get and set [CAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) signals from CAN messages.

## Use of built-in exception types vs. own types

[Redditor asks](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/pft9f2/use_of_builtin_exception_types_vs_own_types/) if they should use standard exception types or add their own exception types. The options presented are:

- Only use `std::exception` and derived classes.
- Use `std::runtime_error` and `std::logic_error` and derived classes.
- Use more specific classes like `std::invalid_argument`, `std::domain_error`, `std::overflow_error` and derived classes.
- Don't derive own exception classes and only use the standard ones.
- Don't use standard exception classes and create own exception hierarchy.

The replies divided between:

- [Don't use exception hierarchy](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/pft9f2/comment/hb6k7zk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and just derive a single exception class from the standard one.
- Whatever you do, [don't use `std::logic_error`](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/pft9f2/comment/hb6p3bu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), as it indicates an unrecoverable bug in the program that can only lead to calling `std::terminate`. (Related: contracts can't come soon enough.)
- We should [prefer wide to deep exception hierarchies](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/pft9f2/comment/hb733gs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and if you need to have additional data in an exception, you can use [Boost.Exception](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/libs/exception/doc/boost-exception.html) (Interestingly, the latest advice from Boost is to use [Boost.LEAF](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/libs/leaf/doc/html/index.html) for error handling, exceptions or not.)

Do you use `std::logic_error` in your code?
