## Library: cpp-lazy

[GitHub](https://github.com/MarcDirven/cpp-lazy)

Cpp-lazy is a fast and easy lazy evaluation library for C++14/17/20.

Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy which holds the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed. In this library, all the iterators are lazy evaluated.

This library is not a replacement for `ranges::v3` but rather a (smaller) alternative.

## The Defold game engine code style

[Article](https://defold.com/2020/05/31/The-Defold-engine-code-style/)

### Code style

* C-like C++
* No classes (_huh?_ -- _GD_)
* No exceptions
* No STL
  * Custom containers
* Data ownership tracking
* C++98

(_It's the end of 2020, by the way. -- GD_)
