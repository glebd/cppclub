## A list of bad practices commonly seen in industrial projects

[The article](https://belaycpp.com/2021/06/01/a-list-of-bad-practices-commonly-seen-in-industrial-projects/) on the [Belay the C++](https://belaycpp.com/) blog discusses bad practices in C++ projects. The list includes:

- Overly long functions
- Creating classes unnecessarily (fully static classes instead of free functions in a namespace, publicly accessible classes instead of `struct`)
- Implementing undefiuned behaviour (the list of UB is too long)
- Comparing signed and unsigned integers
- Premature optimization
- Premature pessimization
- "Just-in-case" programming (_YAGNI_ - _You Ain't Gonna Need It_)

The [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/npq1tb/belay_the_c_a_list_of_bad_practices_commonly_seen/) has some more discussion on the raised topics. The winner is the [following comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/npq1tb/belay_the_c_a_list_of_bad_practices_commonly_seen/h07iis0/):

Regarding classes vs. free functions, the user **staletic** replies to the author's point "_Why would you use class at all, where a namespace suffices?_" with this:

> To shut down ADL and not have users of your library "steal" function calls with their functions.

Apparently Bloomberg C++ guidelines prohibit free functions altogether because of this.
