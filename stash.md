> Swift language and its library. However, yesterday he gave an excellent talk at their Developer
> Conference entitled Embracing Algorithms, which IMHO is general enough to be of interest for C++
> developers as well. The link has a video of that 40 minutes long talk as well as the slides.

## Solving differential equations with LLVM

Heyoka is a C++ library for the integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via Taylor’s method. Notable features include:

* support for both double-precision and extended-precision floating-point types (80-bit and 28-bit),
* the ability to maintain machine precision accuracy over tens of billions of timesteps, batch mode integration to harness the power of modern SIMD instruction sets,
* a high-performance implementation of Taylor’s method based on automatic differentiation techniques and aggressive just-in-time compilation via LLVM.
