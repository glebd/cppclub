# JSON Library from the makers of Boost.Beast

Vinnie Falcou:

> A survey of existing JSON libraries shows impressive diversity and features. However, no library is known to meet all of the design goals mentioned here. In particular, we know of no library that supports incremental parsing and serialization, and also supports custom allocators robustly.
