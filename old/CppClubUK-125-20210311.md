> Hey, I started out with C++ 3 months ago and really love it. I already have some experience in Unity, but I'd like to use C++. Is there any engine you would recommend me to try out? I know about Unreal Engine but I can't find any good tutorials for how to use C++ with Unreal Engine. Is there any other option or a tutorial series or anything you could recommend me?

## Solving differential equations with LLVM

Heyoka is a C++ library for the integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via Taylor’s method. Notable features include:

* support for both double-precision and extended-precision floating-point types (80-bit and 28-bit),
* the ability to maintain machine precision accuracy over tens of billions of timesteps, batch mode integration to harness the power of modern SIMD instruction sets,
* a high-performance implementation of Taylor’s method based on automatic differentiation techniques and aggressive just-in-time compilation via LLVM.
