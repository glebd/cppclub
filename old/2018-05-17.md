* [Docs](https://tzlaine.github.io/text/doc/html/index.html)
* [Intro](https://tzlaine.github.io/text/doc/html/boost_text__proposed_/intro.html)

> C++ is one of a select few major languages with no built-in support for Unicode. If nothing else, this is an embarassment that should be remedied.

# Transwarp 1.3.0

* [Release notes](https://github.com/bloomen/transwarp/releases/tag/1.3.0)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/bloomen/transwarp) -- C++11, MIT
* [Comparison to other libraries](https://github.com/bloomen/transwarp#comparison-to-other-libraries)

*Transwarp* is a header-only C++ library for task concurrency. It enables you to free your functors from explicit threads and transparently manage dependencies. Under the hood, a directed acyclic graph is built that allows for efficient traversal and type-safe dependencies. Use *transwarp* if you want to model your dependent operations in a graph of tasks and intend to invoke the graph more than once.
