# CppCon 2018 Trip Reports

> The Jerk Problem is a very simple one: the larger community seems to value technical excellence over all other values. This means that decency – and being polite during such things as discussion or evaluation – is optional. This is how a lot of people conducted themselves: being successful / making money / having influence somehow justifies their ability to be complete blockheads.

Also:

> Nobody believes I have dark skin ever when they see my videos or meet me. And for some people, that’s a good surprise (but still a problem). Other people think it’s a bad idea I’m here to begin with, which is much more of a problem.

# Hardware Effects

> This repository demonstrates various hardware effects that can degrade application performance in surprising ways and that may be very hard to explain without knowledge of the low-level CPU and OS architecture. For each effect I try to create a proof of concept program that is as small as possible so that it can be understood easily.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/Kobzol/hardware-effects) -- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9y98l5/set_of_c_programs_that_demonstrate_hardware/)
    - Demonstrates: bandwidth saturation, branch misprediction, branch target misprediction, cache aliasing, cache/memory hierarchy bandwidth, data dependencies, denormal floating point numbers, false sharing, hardware prefetching, memory-bound program, non-temporal stores, software prefetching, write combining.
