# IntelliCode in Visual C++

* [VCBlog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/12/05/cppintellicode/)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5Els11sY1A)
    - Uses [SFML: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

> IntelliCode uses machine learning to train over thousands of real-world projects including open-source projects on GitHub. As such, IntelliCode will be most helpful when using common libraries such as STL. Based on this training, IntelliCode saves your time by putting what you’re most likely to use at the top of your IntelliSense completion list.

# IKOS static analyzer from NASA

* [GitHub](https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/ikos)
    - [Reddit announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/a5a5nc/ikos_21_an_open_source_static_analyzer_for_c_and_c/)

IKOS is a **sound** static analyzer for C and C++ based on LLVM, developed at NASA.

Here, **sound** means that it is mathematically correct and cannot miss a bug, thanks to the theory of Abstract Interpretation. The counterpart is that it might produce false positives.

IKOS checks for a lot of undefined behaviors, such as buffer overflows, divisions by zero and so on. The full list is available [here](https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/ikos/blob/master/analyzer/README.md#checks). The list is somewhat similar to UBSan checks.

# Standard Ranges, by Eric Niebler

* [Blog post](http://ericniebler.com/2018/12/05/standard-ranges/)

> Ranges got merged and will be part of C++20. This is huge news and represents probably the biggest shift the Standard Library has seen since it was first standardized way back in 1998.

# Library: SQLite ORM
