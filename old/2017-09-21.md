# CppCon 2016: Richard Smith "There and Back Again: An Incremental C++ Modules Design"

* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1E-XyxqJRE)
* Clang's "C++98 Modules"; GDR in the audience (RS: "Do you like it?" GDS: "I don't know!")
* Modules TS
* Why Google needs macros in modules (`#export_macros`)
  - To support incremental transition (`import legacy foo.h`)
  - [P0273R1: Proposed modules changes from implementation and deployment experience](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0273r1.pdf)

# C++Now 2017 keynote: Ali Cehreli - Competitive Advantage with D

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYEKEIpM2zo)

* Unified call syntax:

```cpp
auto minutes(int n) { ... }
minutes(10);
10.minutes;

writeln(evens(divide(multiply(values, 10), 3)));
values.multiply(10).divide(3).evens.writeln;
```

# Accelerating your C++ on GPU with [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl)

* [Post](https://blog.tartanllama.xyz/sycl/) by Simon Brand ([@TartanLlama](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama))
* Code samples
* Intro to GPGPU computing
* Libraries: [triSYCL](https://github.com/Xilinx/triSYCL) and [ComputeCpp](https://www.codeplay.com/products/computesuite/computecpp)
* [SyclParallelSTL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SyclParallelSTL) implements [Parallelism TS](https://github.com/cplusplus/parallelism-ts)

> Transferring data from main memory to the GPU is slow. Really slow. Like, kill all your performance and get you fired slow.

# Polymorphic clones in modern C++

[Jonathan Boccara](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/09/08/make-polymorphic-copy-modern-cpp/)

* "virtual constructors" returning covariant bare pointers
* "virtual constructors" returning `unique_ptr<Interface>`
* multiple inheritance: use different "constructor" names

[Quentin Duval](https://deque.blog/2017/09/08/how-to-make-a-better-polymorphic-clone/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6yug0q/how_to_make_a_better_polymorphic_clone_in_modern/)

* provide a free function `clone` to wrap the returned pointers in `unique_ptr`
* Non-Virtual Interface + CRTP
* additionally, return pointers using GSL's `owner`

# Thoughts on destructive move

[Post](http://foonathan.net/blog/2017/09/14/destructive-move.html)

* Move operations are allowed to throw
  - [`std::move_if_noexcept`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/move_if_noexcept)
* Move operations are potentially expensive
* Moved-from state

The Release Uncertainty Principle says you can accurately know what the software will do, or when you will get it, but not both.
