## Bjarne Stroustrup on "dead bodies of type theorists"

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j90thn/bjarne_stroustrup_on_dead_bodies_of_type_theorists/)

> I can't produce a link off the top of my head, but I remember Bjarne Stroustrup saying (on a few occasions, in a talk or a panel) that "non-type template parameters were introduced in C++ over the dead bodies of some type theorists" (quote from memory). This surprises me since types depending on values is a fundamental concept in Martin-Löf type theory which is older than C++. Does anyone have any knowledge on what feedback Bjarne Stroustrup received from type theorists?

## Clang 11 released
