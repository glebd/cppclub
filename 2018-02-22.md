# Pre-Jacksonville C++ Committee meeting papers

[List](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/2018-02-pre-Jacksonville.htm)

# p0713r1: Identifying Module Source

[p0713r1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0713r1.html)

# P0906R0: Improvement suggestions for the Modules TS, by Jens Maurer

[P0906R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0906r0.html)

* Different access paths to a type (term: "attendant entity")
* Definitions of inline functions (also: `constexpr`)
* Allow vacuous exports
* Exclude private members from attendant entities

# P0909R0: Module TS Supports Legacy Integration, by Steve Downey (Bloomberg)

[P0909R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0909r0.html)

```cpp
// facility module interface unit
#include <facility.h> // outside the purview of module facility

export module facility;

export namespace facility {}
export using facility::Foo;  // exports complete type Foo
export using facility::func; // exports both func from facility
export using facility::BAR;  // exports BAR, and associated enumerators
```

# P0923r0: Modules:Dependent ADL, by Nathan Sidwell (Facebook)

[P0923r0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0923r0.pdf)

Proposed changes:

* Internal-Linkage Entities Cannot Be Found From Outside
* ADL is Consistent

# P0924r0: Modules: Context-Sensitive Keyword, by Nathan Sidwell (Facebook)

[P0924r0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0924r0.pdf)

# P0925r0: Modules: Unqualified Using Declarations, by Nathan Sidwell (Facebook)

[P0925r0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0925r0.pdf)

The proposal is that an unqualified name could be employed in a *using-declaration*, in at least some circumstances:

* *Using-declarations* may take an unqualified name
* Such an unqualified *using-declaration* must find a binding in the current namespace
* Only unqualified *using-declarations* may be exported

# Modules and macros

* [p0947R0: Another take on Modules, by Richard Smith (Google)](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0947r0.html)
    * [Macro Export](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0947r0.html#macro-export)
* [p0955r0: Modules and Macros, by Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0955r0.pdf)

# P0501R3: C++ Module TS Issues List, by Gabriel Dos Reis

[P0501R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0501r3.pdf)

# P0797R1: Handling Concurrent Exceptions with Executors, by Matti Rintala, Michael Wong, Carter Edwards, Patrice Roy, Gordon Brown, Mark Hoemmen

[P0797R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0797r1.pdf)

Problem:

In concurrent execution it is possible for several parallel executions to throw exceptions
asynchronously. If more than one of these exceptions end up in the same thread of execution, the
situation is problematic, since C++ allows only one exception to propagate at any time.

# Practical `constexpr` - Jason Turner - Meeting C++ 2017

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtf9qkDTrZE)

* A C++17 `constexpr` function:
    * is not `virtual`
    * takes literal types and returns a literal type
    * is `=delete`, `=default`, or doesn't contain:
        * an `asm` definition
        * a `goto` statement
        * an identifier label
        * a `try` block
        * a definition of a variable of non-literal type (or `static` or `thread_local`) for which no initialization is performed

# Practical `constexpr` - Jason Turner - Meeting C++ 2017 (cont.)

* Problematic:
    * broken standard library implementations
    * poor standard library support for algorithms
    * a cascade of 'viral' `constexpr` usage

* Worth it for:
    * code simplification
    * reduction of dynamic allocations
    * startup performance
    * runtime performance

# Practical `constexpr` - Jason Turner - Meeting C++ 2017 (cont.)

Constructors are not functions: you cannot take an address of a constructor.
