# Exception handling in constructors

```cpp
A::A(int& n) try : B(n), cObject(0), x(-1), y(n) {
}
catch(Exception& e) {
    //Option 1: Throw same exception
    //Option 2: Log and thrown another exception
    //Option 3: Exception thrown automatically on reaching end of handler
}
catch(AnotherException& e) {
    //Option 1: Throw same exception
    //Option 2: Log and thrown another exception
    //Option 3: Exception thrown automatically on reaching end of handler
}
```

# Exception handling in constructors

* Use with constructors that have initializer list that calls a user-defined constructor that can throw.
* You can replace the exception being thrown and cause some useful side effects such as log the failure.

# The rise of the new language MC++

## [http://cppdepend.com/blog/?p=171](http://cppdepend.com/blog/?p=171)

* Folly by Facebook as a modern C++ library example
* `auto` everywhere
* `nullptr`
* `std::shared_ptr`

---

# The rise of the new language MC++

* Scoped enums
* `static_assert`
* variadic templates
* range `for` loops
* `std::initializer_list`
* `noexcept`

---

# The rise of the new language MC++

* `std::thread`
* unordered containers
* `default` and `delete` special member functions
* `override`
* lambdas
* `std::move` (doesn't move) and `std::forward` (doesn't forward)

# To move or not to move

## [http://www.stroustrup.com/move.pdf](http://www.stroustrup.com/move.pdf)

Discusses issues with generating implicit copy and move operations.

> To have move useful, it must be implicitly generated in many cases. To minimize surprises and bugs, no move operations should be generated for classes with a user-specified copy, move, or destructor. To keep the rules consistent, the generation of copy operations should be deprecated for classes with a user-specified copy, move, or destructor.

#Â Declaration style

Style 1

```cpp
const char *foo = "Foo"; // * and & bind to the right
```

Style 2

```cpp
const char* foo = "Foo"; // the type is 'pointer to const char'
```

Style 3

```cpp
char const *foo = "Foo"; // declaration reads from right to left
```

# A New C++ YouTube Channel

[Abhisekh Gupta teaches C++](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmfC_avrfQv9KPtwVZIKmw)

* uses Turbo C++ within DosBox within Windows 10
* why?
* what (if anything) should we tell him?
