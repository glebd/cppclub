# C++ in 2018, by Jens Weller, Meeting C++

* 2-space indents, no tabs
* No exceptions
* Constructors shouldn't do any real work, the real initialization is done in `Create()` or `TryCreate()`
* Destructors are empty, all deinitialization is done in `Destroy()`
* Integer scalars are signed
* No `enum` data members (size is implementation-specific)
* Output parameters are pointers, not references ("References can be confusing")
* Function parameter order: output, update, input
* Use C-style casts. Do not use C++-style casts ("The brevity of the C-style cast outweighs the semantic benefits of explicitness of C++-style casts")
* Under no circumstances should the keyword `mutable` be used
