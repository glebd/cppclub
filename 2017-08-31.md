# Functional data structures in C++ by Bartosz Milewski, C++Now 2014

* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsB09djvfl4)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/BartoszMilewski/Okasaki)
* [Blog post](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2013/11/13/functional-data-structures-in-c-lists/)
* C++ (naive implementation) vs. Haskell is 1000x slower:
    * heap allocation: big blobs vs. small chunks
    * smart pointers vs. GC
    * native (non-pooled) threads vs. lightweight threads
    * sub-optimal synchronisation
    * not using move semantics properly
    * `std::function` allocates
