# Functional data structures in C++ by Bartosz Milewski, C++Now 2014

* [Blog post](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2013/11/13/functional-data-structures-in-c-lists/)
* C++ (naive implementation) vs. Haskell is 1000x slower:
    * heap allocation: big blobs vs. small chunks
    * smart pointers vs. GC
    * native (non-pooled) threads vs. lightweight threads
    * sub-optimal synchronisation
    * not using move semantics properly
    * `std::function` allocates

# MTuner

[GitHub](https://github.com/milostosic/MTuner)

MTuner is a C/C++ memory profiler and memory leak finder for Windows, PS4, PS3, etc.

MTuner utilizes a novel approach to memory profiling and analysis, keeping entire time-based history of memory operations. This gives an unique insight in memory related behavior of your software by making queries over the entire data set.
