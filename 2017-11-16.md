# Feature macros

# From Vulkan with love: a plea to reconsider the Module Keyword to be contextual

[P0795R0](http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2017/p0795r0.pdf)

The `module` keyword is already being used in many code bases as identifier.

# Business Requirements for Modules

[P0678R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0678r0.pdf) by John Lakos, Bloomberg

Some are looking, primarily, to reduce protracted build times for template-ladened header files. Others want to use modules as a vehicle to clean up impure vestiges of the language, such as macros, that leak out into client code. Still others are looking to "modernize" the way we view C++ rendering completely -- even if it means forking the language. These are all very different motivations, and they may or may not be entirely compatible, but if the agreed-upon implementation of modules does not take into account established code bases, such as Bloomberg's, they will surely fall far short of wide-spread adoption by industry.

# Module TS Wording Does Not Support Intended Use Case

[P0832R0](http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2017/p0832r0.html) by Bloomberg

Exposing existing code as a module should involve providing a new module interface unit that can reuse existing source files without modification such that current consumers are not broken.

# Modules at scale

[P0841R0](http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2017/p0841r0.html) by Apple

This paper discusses Apple's experience with modules on its software ecosystem and how the current state of the [Modules TS](http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2017/n4681.pdf) lacks the necessary expressiveness to reflect Apple's requirements.

Problems of Modules TS:

* The `module` keyword is not context-sensitive
* A module can only have one module interface unit file (showstopper)
* Macros are used to manage OS feature availability (showstopper, transition needed)

```cpp
export module M; // declare module M
export module M.__macros; // M export all macros
export module M.__macros.INFINITY; // M exports macro INFINITY
```

# Clang 6 Documentation: Modules (not Modules TS!)

[Clang 6 website](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html)

* Problems with header files: compile-time scalability, fragility, conventional workarounds, tool confusion

Problems modules don't solve:

* Rewrite the world's code
* Versioning
* Namespaces
* Binary distribution of modules

# Proposed modules changes from implementation and deployment experience, by Google

# Does C++ need a universal package manager?

* [Article by Paul Fultz II](http://pfultz2.com/blog/2017/10/27/universal-package-manager/)
* [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/79a0x3/does_c_need_a_universal_package_manager/)
* [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15578065)
* Many package managers but no standard build system for C++
* A platform-independent package manager for C++ must effectively degrade into a build system that rebuilds all dependencies from source (Rust & Cargo)

> What C++ needs is a common format to communicate a package’s requirements among different package manager tools.

# CppCon 2017: Boris Kolpackov "Building C++ Modules"

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8EbDcLQAoc)

* Isolation from macros and symbols
* A physical design mechanism
* A step towards not needing the preprocessor
* Reliable distributed compilation
* Faster builds
* Interesting questions from John Lakos (how to support modules given a huge legacy codebase)

# CppCon 2017: Boris Kolpackov "C++ Modules and Packages: Making Dreams Come True"

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxFrhYAYF3M) (5m)

A live demo of using *build2* package manager and build system with C++ Modules.

# Common C++ Modules TS Misconceptions

[Post](https://build2.org/article/cxx-modules-misconceptions.xhtml) by Boris Kolpackov

* "I cannot have everything in a single file" -- you can
* "I cannot export macros from modules" -- good
* "I cannot modularize existing code without touching it" -- some duplication required
* "No build system will be able to support modules" -- *build2*

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/7a3t2w/common_c_modules_ts_misconceptions/)

* It would be good if people interested in modules would read the whole proposal.
* Nothing in the current proposal mandates a binary module interface (BMI) or that it has to be a file. Is that a good thing?

# CppCon 2017: Isabella Muerte "There Will Be Build Systems: I Configure Your Milkshake"

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7THzO-D0ta4&t=3s)

* The C++ ecosystem is really bad (compared to other languages)
* Discusses complexities of build systems
* Mentions meta-build systems (CMake, Meson, Premake)

# CppCast: Build Systems and Modules with Isabella Muerte

[CppCast](http://cppcast.com/2017/10/isabella-muerte/)

* A great confusion exists on what exactly are C++ Modules, even in the Committee
* Build systems need to understand modules (Gabriel Dos Reyes)
* *build2* is currently the only build system supporting all existing implementations of Modules TS

# Why the C++ modules feature is very important for the C++ future?

# C++ Modules, what are they for?

[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/7b2och/c_modules/) with a "Modules Lite" proposal

**Goals of Modules TS**

1. componentization;
2. isolation from macros;
3. scalable build;
4. support for modern semantics-aware developer tools.

Furthermore, the proposal reduces opportunities for violations of the One Definition Rule (ODR), and increases practical type-safe linking.
