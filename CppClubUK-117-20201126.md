## The Defold game engine code style

[Article](https://defold.com/2020/05/31/The-Defold-engine-code-style/)

### Code style

* C-like C++
* No classes (_huh?_ -- _GD_)
* No exceptions
* No STL
  * Custom containers
* Data ownership tracking
* C++98

(_It's the end of 2020, by the way. -- GD_)

## FTL - A functional template library for containers processing in C++

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ftlorg/ftl)
  * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jor2hd/ftl_a_functional_template_library_for_containers/)

FTL is a C++17-based library that provides a more convenient API for collections processing. The API is heavily inspired by the Rust programming language.

```cpp
const auto totalVolume = cityTrees.iter()
  .filter([](c onst auto &tree) { return tree.kind == Tree::Oak && tree.diameter > 25; })
  .map([](const auto &tree) { return tree.volume(); })
  .sum();
```
