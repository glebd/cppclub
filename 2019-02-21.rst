Moving iterators in C++
-----------------------

https://cukic.co/2019/02/09/moving-iterators-in-cxx/

    ``std::move_iterator`` is an iterator adaptor which behaves exactly like the underlying iterator, except that dereferencing converts the value returned by the underlying iterator into an *rvalue*. (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/move_iterator)

.. code:: c++

    std::vector<fs::directory_entry> results;
    auto dir_items = files_in_dir(...);
    results.insert(results.end(), dir_items.cbegin(), dir_items.cend());

Low-cost Deterministic C++ Exceptions for Embedded Systems

James Renwick, Tom Spink, Bj√∂rn Franke (University of Edinburgh)

    In our novel C++ exception implementation we make use of a stack-allocated object that records the necessary run-time information for throwing an exception, such as the type and size of the exception object. This state is allocated in a single place and is passed between functions via an implicit function parameter injected into functions which support exceptions. The state is initialised by ``throw`` expressions, and is re-used to enable re-throwing. ``catch`` statements use the state in order to determine whether they can handle the exception. After a call to a function which may throw exceptions, a run-time check is inserted to test whether the state containsan active exception.
