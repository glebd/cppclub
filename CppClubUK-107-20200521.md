## The New York ISO C++ meeting is postponed

* [Herb Sutter](https://herbsutter.com/2020/05/20/the-new-york-iso-c-meeting-is-postponed/)

> We had already postponed the Varna meeting originally planned for June 1-6, and earlier today INCITS (the U.S. national body) announced that it was banning all face-to-face standards meetings for the rest of the year, so we are also postponing the New York meeting previously planned for November 9-14.

## Goals and priorities for C++

* [P2137R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2137r0.html)

> This paper describes the goals and priorities which the authors believe make C++ an especially effective programming language for our use cases. That said, our experience, use cases, and needs are clearly not those of every user. We aren’t pushing to directly build consensus on these points. Rather, this is presented as a vehicle to advertise our needs from C++ as a high-performance systems language.
