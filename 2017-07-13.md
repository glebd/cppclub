# Exception handling in constructors

* Function `try` block
* [https://medium.com/cpp-station/exception-handling-in-constructors-26bf4c811b46](https://medium.com/cpp-station/exception-handling-in-constructors-26bf4c811b46)

# Exception handling in constructors

```cpp
A::A(int& n) try : B(n), cObject(0), x(-1), y(n) {
}
catch(Exception& e) {
    //Option 1: Throw same exception
    //Option 2: Log and thrown another exception
    //Option 3: Exception thrown automatically on reaching end of handler
}
catch(AnotherException& e) {
    //Option 1: Throw same exception
    //Option 2: Log and thrown another exception
    //Option 3: Exception thrown automatically on reaching end of handler
}
```

# Exception handling in constructors

* Use with constructors that have initializer list that calls a user-defined constructor that can throw.
* You can replace the exception being thrown and cause some useful side effects such as log the failure.

# The rise of the new language MC++

[http://cppdepend.com/blog/?p=171](http://cppdepend.com/blog/?p=171)

* Folly by Facebook as a modern C++ library example
* `auto` everywhere
* `nullptr`
* `std::shared_ptr`

---

# The rise of the new language MC++

* Scoped enums
* `static_assert`
* variadic templates
* range `for` loops
* `std::initializer_list`
* `noexcept`

---

# The rise of the new language MC++

* `std::thread`
* unordered containers
* `default` and `delete` special member functions
* `override`
* lambdas
* `std::move` (doesn't move) and `std::forward` (doesn't forward)

# To move or not to move

[http://www.stroustrup.com/move.pdf](http://www.stroustrup.com/move.pdf)

Discusses issues with generating implicit copy and move operations.

> To have move useful, it must be implicitly generated in many cases. To minimize surprises and bugs, no move operations should be generated for classes with a user-specified copy, move, or destructor. To keep the rules consistent, the generation of copy operations should be deprecated for classes with a user-specified copy, move, or destructor.

# Thinking Outside the Synchronisation Quadrant

## Kevlin Henney, ACCU 2017

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJrmee7o68A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJrmee7o68A)

- synchronization only needed for shared mutable data
- instead of threads why not use message passing between processes
- "processes" can be lightweight (Erlang)
- agents react to messages
- no synchronization needed within message handlers

# 'Meaningful' casts

## Vittorio Romeo — Meeting C++ 2015

[YouTube (12m)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62c_Xm6Zh1k)

Range-checked casts

```cpp
template <typename TOut, typename TIn>
constexpr auto to_num(const TIn& x) noexcept {...}
```

```cpp
int a{10};
to_num<float>(a);
to_num<int>(-1); // OK
to_num<unsigned int>(-1); // Run-time assertion
to_num<float>(NAN); // Run-time assertion
```

Also: `from_enum`, `to_enum`, support for `std::aligned_storage_t`, casts along inheritance hierarchy, etc.

# An Effective C++11/14 Sampler

## Scott Meyers (Going Native, 2013)

[Video (1h 15m)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/An-Effective-Cpp11-14-Sampler)

* Understand `std::move` and `std::forward`
* Declare functions `noexcept` whenever possible
* Make `std::thread`s unjoinable on all paths

# An Effective C++11/14 Sampler

## Scott Meyers (Going Native, 2013)

```cpp
class ThreadRAII {
public:
    typedef void (std::thread::*RAIIAction)();
    ThreadRAII(std::thread&& thread, RAIIAction a)
    : t(std::move(thread)), action(a) {}
    ~ThreadRAII()
    {if (t.joinable()) (t.*action)();} // race condition?
    std::thread& get() {return t;}
private:
    RAIIAction action;
    std::thread t;
};

ThreadRAII t1(std::thread(doThisWork), &std::thread::join);

# Undefined Behavior in 2017

by John Regehr (Professor of Computer Science, University of Utah, USA) and Pascal Cuoq

[Article](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1520)

* Goal 1: Every UB (yes, all ~200 of them, we’ll give the list towards the end of this post) must either be documented as having some defined behavior, be diagnosed with a fatal compiler error, or else — as a last resort — have a sanitizer that detects that UB at runtime.
* Goal 2: Every UB must either be documented as having some defined behavior, be diagnosed with a fatal compiler error, or else have an optional mitigation mechanism that meets the requirements above.

# Presenting Code

* Use dark-on-light colour scheme
* Avoid dark backgrounds as syntax-highlighted code becomes invisible or very hard to read
* Consider effects of video compression
* Think about colour-blind developers
