## Feedback

Roi Barkan commented on the last episode:

- [Regarding the proposed shorthand concepts syntax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uONoChyos_M&lc=Ugz5VHP3noSJ8NJNueF4AaABAg): ‚ÄúI believe C++23 has a new meaning for `auto{x}` which is decay-copy of `x`, and thus it‚Äôs problematic to use it for ‚Äúconcepts in-place‚Äù
- [Regarding proposed safety profiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uONoChyos_M&lc=Ugwn6PcJur4clqjpWlh4AaABAg): ‚ÄúI wonder if there‚Äôs thought given to backward compatibility of profiles (e.g. if a piece of code complies with profile X in year 2023 can we allow the same code to be marked non-compliant with profile X in 2025 or 2029). As time goes by more profile checks can be implemented, and I personally think they should be encouraged regardless of compatibility.‚Äù
- [Regarding ‚Äúerroneous behaviour‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uONoChyos_M&lc=Ugz6hYAB2Wv9f2GffAp4AaABAg): ‚ÄúI think an example of errors of this nature are things referred to as IFNDR (ill formed, no diagnostics required). For example, I‚Äôm not sure but I think violations of the ‚Äúone definition rule‚Äù can‚Äôt always be caught across translation units (by the linker) and thus considered as such an error. One difference from UB is that the compiler is required to compile UB code successfully, and allowed to fail on IFNDR‚Äù

## We have C++23!

Some venting from the thread regarding networking, by [Niall Douglas](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/10zucok/c23_hits_the_road/j8bkou2/):

> I presented a bare minimum viable vehicle for C++ 26 Networking at the Issaquah meeting, made viable mainly by dropping anything to do with async. It got killed. Committee wants async. Committee also wants several ponies and many unicorns in Networking. Committee wants it all, and currently doesn't seem to care if that makes timely delivery impossible. I especially remember in the comments to my paper around the room there were clearly three separate factions, most with the opinion *"either it's my networking or I'm strongly against/over my dead body because the networking of the other tribe is the worst and would actively destroy my networking for various vague reasons"* <...>

Looks like ASIO will be the C++ networking go-to solution for the foreseeable future.

[Niall Douglas writes](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/117rvn5/upcoming_changes_to_c_bjarne_stroustrup_gabriel/j9ezzsl/):

> After Bjarne's presentation there was much outside of room chatter about his proposal. I won't go into details, but suffice it to say that several leading committee members felt it has similar showstopper issues as Epochs had. If they succeed in persuading EWG of the same, those proposals in their current formulation are dead in the water.

A heated discussion follows, including [this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/117rvn5/upcoming_changes_to_c_bjarne_stroustrup_gabriel/j9hyipj/):

> I was one of the people who opposed. To me, the question was ambiguous, paraphrasing:

They go on to explain their objections.

My word, C++ developers are so emotional! Speaking of:

## A Reaction to Dr. Stroustrup‚Äôs Recent Memory Safety Comments

[Article by Jimmy Hartzell](https://www.thecodedmessage.com/posts/stroustrup-response/)

> To be honest, I was disappointed. As a current die-hard Rustacean and former die-hard C++ programmer, I have thought (and blogged) quite a bit about the topic of Rust vs C++. Unfortunately, I feel that in spite of the exhortation in his title to ‚Äúthink seriously about safety,‚Äù Dr. Stroustrup was not in fact thinking seriously himself.

Oh boy. The article contains so much venting it could fill a surveillance air balloon. There are a few straw-man arguments (including a jab at Bjarne for allegedly using a straw-man argument) and _a lot_ of pent-up emotion. An entire section is dedicated to defending the use of "C/C++".

The tone of the article is quite condescending, that of the "I know better" variety, and honestly makes for an unpleasant reading. (Maybe it's just me.)

I mean, you are a fan of Rust and don't like C++, I get it. Just keep using Rust, nobody is taking it away from you. For Rust to become popular, C++ doesn't have to disappear. But no, it's a zero-sum game for the author, who cannot stop himself explaining to Bjarne and the rest of us the errors of our ways.

The author's [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/thecodedmessage) says:

> Systems programmer in Rust, Haskell fan, had a bitter break-up with C++ and never looked back.

For someone who "never looked back" he seems _obsessed_ with his "ex".

To sum it up: I read these sorts of articles so that you don't have to. Don't waste your time on this one.

## Rust Safety Is Not Superior To C++, Bjarne Stroustrup Says

[Slashdot](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/23/01/21/0526236/rust-safety-is-not-superior-to-c-bjarne-stroustrup-says)

Something I thought I'd never say, but a pretty sane discussion on Slashdot.

The Evil Atheist [writes](https://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=22726336&cid=63228452):

> You don't need to change the C++ model. You can write static analysis tools to do the same thing, which is exactly what he talks about even in the summary. You literally can write a borrow checker as a tool, rather than make it part of a compiler.
>
> The Core Standard Guideline support library is one of those things that, coupled with the newer language capabilities, is being used to do stuff like this.

## About Safety, Security and yes, C++ and Rust

[Article by David Teller](https://yoric.github.io/post/safety-and-security/)

> I‚Äôve seen many misunderstandings about what safety means in programming and how programming languages can implement, help or hinder safety.

A very sane and entertaining reaction to the NSA and Consumer Reports documents regarding "C/C++" (ye gods) and the resulting Reddit threads.

> Your favorite language is not perfectly safe. It is not perfectly secure. It is not even safer and more secure than most other languages for all teams of developers, all domains, all threat models.
>
> If you‚Äôre reading these lines and must remember only one thing, please, fellow developers in `$(YOUR FAVORITE LANGUAGE)`, stop trolling developers with different experience. Chances are that they are perfectly right to use these tools that you despise. Even if they‚Äôre not, trolling is not constructive.

He ends with this:

> Use whichever language makes sense for your goal, specs and threat model. There are many use cases in which I will be using Rust if I have a choice. But I‚Äôll happily use a different tool if it feels appropriate.

Very well put.

### Paper: Introduction of `std::hive` to the standard library

[P0447R21](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p0447r21.html)

C++26?

### Paper: A Big Decimal Type

[P2159R1](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2159r1.html)

> This paper proposes an exact decimal type that can be used as either a fixed point type or a floating point type with an implementation-defined maximum precision.

### Paper: Towards memory safety in C++

[P2771R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2771r0.html) by Thomas Neumann

Lifetime annotations for function parameters combined with a general opt-in safety annotation.

### Paper: Not halting the program after detected contract violation

[P2784R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2784r0.html) by Andrzej Krzemie≈Ñski

>  This paper explores the possibility of not stopping the program after a contract violation has been detected at run-time. This is a feature to be added to the contract support framework.

Proposed solutions:

* Exceptions (but what if we have a throwing condition check in a destructor? ‚Äî *how about don‚Äôt do that?*)
* Aborting the component (!)

>  As a potential solution to the above problem we propose a mechanism that is harsher than stack unwinding, but softer than `std::abort()`. In fact we are proposing a stricter and simpler version of the `setjmp`/`longjmp` mechanism

We did manage to avoid throwing from destructors so far‚Ä¶

### Paper: `do` expressions

[P2806R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2806r0.html) by Bruno Cardoso Lopes, Zach Laine, Michael Park, Barry Revzin

```cpp
int x = do { do return 42; };
```

This solves a problem of specifying expressions in [pattern matching](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2806r0.html#ref-P1371R3).
