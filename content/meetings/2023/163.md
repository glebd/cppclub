> We introduce FloatZone, a compiler-based sanitizer to detect spatial and temporal memory errors in C/C++ programs using lightweight checks that leverage the Floating Point Unit (FPU). We show that the combined effects of “lookup, compare, and branch” can be achieved with a single floating point addition that triggers an underflow exception in the case of a memory violation.
>
> Our evaluation shows that FloatZone significantly outperforms existing systems, with just 37% runtime overhead <...>
>
> <...> on every load and store ASan looks up the corresponding metadata, compares it to see if it is part of a redzone and branches to exit code that raises an alarm if this is the case. The branch instruction pollutes the branch predictor and contends with the application for CPU execution units. <...> The key insight in this paper is that sanitizer checks never fail in the normal case and should add little overhead except in the event of a violation of memory safety. In an ideal world, the sanitizer should use a special, fast instruction that is branchless, does not contend with the application for CPU execution units, and checks the validity of memory implicitly—raising an exception upon a violation. While modern CPUs lack such a targeted instruction, we will show that they do have instructions that approximate exactly this behavior.
>
> In particular, we find that a floating point addition can be made to generate an exception if it processes redzone data. We achieve this by configuring a single floating point addition to result in an underflow exception only if one of the operands is equal to our redzone poison value. By instrumenting vulnerable loads/stores with the addition, we ensure that redzone accesses raise an alarm. Moreover, the addition is fast and branchless and executes on an execution unit that is underutilized in most programs. As a result, the solution ensures high instruction-level parallelism and much better performance than prior techniques.

Interesting snippet:

```cpp
inspect(foo) { _ => bar; };
```

Michael Park worked on the placeholder paper. Was that [yak shaving](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/yak-shaving-defined-ill-get-that-done-as-soon-as-i-shave-this-yak) for Pattern Matching?

[Daniela Engert](https://hachyderm.io/@DanielaKEngert/110656421838217771) seems to confirm my suspicion:

> The latest discussions regarding pattern matching can be found here: \
> P2688 pattern matching in general https://wg21.link/p2688 \
> P2806 do expressions (likely on track for C++26) https://wg21.link/P2806 \
> P2169 placeholder '_' https://wg21.link/P2169 (voted into the CD in Varna) \
> I think there's a good chance to complete pattern matching in C++26 🤔🙏‬

## Status of Reflection

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/13tytpx/what_is_the_current_status_of_reflection_in_c26/)

> <...> reflection is "dead" in the practical sense: no one's working on it. Andrew Sutton's P2237R0 paper <...>, is 3 years old. The last paper about it [P2560R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2560r0.pdf) is over a year old. The [SG7 public email archive](https://lists.isocpp.org/sg7/) doesn't show any discussion in over a year. The Slack channel for it in on cpplang hasn't had a message in almost two years.

## What C++ library do you wish existed but hasn’t been created yet?

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/14ugtij/what_c_library_do_you_wish_existed_but_hasnt_been/)

Somehow most redditors in the thread assumed it's about the Standard Library, but looks like it wasn't.

## The Register: C language inventor spurns Google's language exam

* [The Register, 2010](https://www.theregister.com/2010/04/21/ken_thompson_take_our_test/)

> Between 1969 and 1973, Ken Thompson created Unix with Dennis Ritchie. At the same time he also developed the C language. The speed and simplicity of C helped Unix spread widely. Both have subsequently become quite popular.
>
> Google hired Thompson to create a new language, Go. But Google also requires all of its recruits to pass a language test. According to Thompson, he hasn't quite got round to it yet - and so can't submit code.

From the book _Coders At Work_:

> Q: I know Google has a policy where every new employee has to get checked out on languages before they're allowed to check code in. Which means you had to get checked out on C [which you co-created].
>
> Thompson: Yeah, I haven't been.
>
> Q. You haven't been! You're not allowed to check in code?
>
> Thompson: I'm not allowed to check in code, no... I just haven't done it. I've so far found no need to.

## The Downto Operator

* [lovegame on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@lovegame/110465003182338465)

> does anyone else use the C/C++ "downto" operator unironically or is it just me

```cpp
while (size --> 0) {

}
```
