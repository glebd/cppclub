From Twitter:

____
WG21 meeting in Kona is over. SG21 approved our paper with a new Contracts syntax: https://wg21.link/p2961r2

The double square brackets are gone, contract checks are now spelled like this:

[source,cpp]
----
int f(int x)
  pre (x > 0)
  post (r: r > x)
{
  contract_assert(i > 0);
  return x + i;
}
----

The _natural_ syntax has won apparently, but `contract_assert`, seriously? https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/17ttjmd/a_backwardscompatible_assert_keyword_for_contract/[Reddit thread on a possible solution].

From Herb Sutter's talk:

The attribute-like syntax would have stood out better IMHO, but whatever. As long as Contracts are in C++26...

Also: REFLECTION!

Pattern matching: current target is C++29! <sadface>

From https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/17vnfqq/202311_kona_iso_c_committee_trip_report_second/[Inbal Levy's Reddit post comments]:

____
P2971R1: Implication for C++ "There was mild opposition and many neutrals, but also significant interest from a small but vocal set of people." Ok vocal minority, return with your next proposal, but just don't steal => for your niche purpose rather than something more valuable and common like a terse lambda many have asked for (and many more have asked for that than have ever asked for implication). https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/17vnfqq/202311_kona_iso_c_committee_trip_report_second/[↑]

=== Paper: std::optional<T&>

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2988r0.html[P2988R0] by Steve Downey and Peter Sommerlad

____
We propose to fix a hole intentionally left in **std::optional**: An optional over a reference such that the post condition on assignment is independent of the engaged state, always producing a rebound reference, and assigning a **U** to a **T** is disallowed by **static_assert** if a **U** can not be bound to a **T&**.

== Video: Herb Sutter - Cooperative C\++ Evolution - Toward a TypeScript for C++ (CppCon 2023)

https://youtu.be/8U3hl8XMm8c

{{<youtube 8U3hl8XMm8c>}}

https://herbsutter.com/2023/10/09/my-new-cppcon-talk-is-on-youtube-cooperative-c-evolution-toward-a-typescript-for-c/[Follow-up post on Herb's blog]

"Safety for C\++ 50x, simplicity for C++ 10x". Round numbers in slogans are a red flag for me, but OK.

Asking the audience: "How many of you would be interested in seeing C\++ get significantly simpler and type/memory safer?" is a bit cheap. I'm not a fan of this style of presentation. Especially given that Herb's "solution" is not actually C++ as such.

That Beetles song again, <eyeroll>. "All you need is class". jfc

"This is pure 100% C+\+." Proceeds to show non-C++ code, often invoking Bjarne's name for validation (?).

"Swift is a TypeScript for Objective-C" --- WHAT.

Says it's just a personal experiment, then tells the audience that "the TypeScript way" (Cpp2) is the only way forward for C++ "because people are telling us gradual evolution is not good enough".

Sorry, I shouldn't be so pessimistic and cynical. It's easy to criticise without doing the actual work. Cpp2 could be our future. Or Herb could be trailblazing actual new C++ features, like the above UFCS.

But the whole talk feels like an ad.

____
Stroustrup's keynote - specifically the last point in the slide where it mentions that successor languages are welcome, but they're not C\++ is relevant here. No matter how much you try and sugarcoat it as a "TypeScript for C++". https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/171o3q9/cooperative_c_evolution_toward_a_typescript_for_c/[↑]

== How are you doing?

Of course, the proper British way is to always reply, "I'm good, thanks".
