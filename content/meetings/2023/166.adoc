Roi Barkan commented on https://youtu.be/WpXW42iYP_k[Episode 165]:

____
I think the “erroneous behavior” proposal is meant to allow the standard to specify situations where it is allowed to either fail on, or to allow - but be deterministic if it allows the situation.

To try and clarify, here are various situations the standard describes:

* ILL-Formed: compilation must fail
* Undefined Behavior: compilation must succeed (compiler might warn), but code can do ANYTHING
* ILL-Formed-No-Diagnostics-Required (IFNDR) - compilation is allowed to fail or generate code that can do ANYTHING
* Erroneous Behavior - compilation is allowed to fail, or generate deterministic (not explode) behavior

Nothing on Reflection or Pattern Matching.

=== Paper: A Principled Approach to Open Design Questions for Contracts

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2932r0.pdf[P2932R0] by Joshua Berne

> The Contracts MVP being developed by SG211 is progressing smoothly toward a complete proposal according to the agreed-upon schedule.

Hold that thought.

=== Paper: A Bold Plan for a Complete Contracts Facility

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2755r0.pdf[P2755R0] by Joshua Berne, Jake Fevold, John Lakos.

A wild paper appears, 48 pages long! Is this the complete Contracts proposal that builds on top of the MVP, or is this something else? I think I've seen that before, can't put my finger on it...

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2762r1.pdf[P2762R1] by Dietmar Kühl

Remember Networking TS? It lives! Kind of.

=== Paper: Erroneous behaviour for missing return from assignment

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2973r0.html[P2973R0] by Jonathan Wakely and Thomas Köppe

> We propose to change the behaviour of flowing off the end of an overloaded assignment operator from undefined to erroneous, erroneously returning `*this`.

[source,c++]
----
struct Foo {
  Foo& operator=(const Foo& rhs) {
    x = rhs.x;
    y = rhs.y;
    // error: forgot "return *this;"!
  }
};

=== Paper: Implication for C++

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2971r0.pdf[P2971R0] by Walter E. Brown

> This paper proposes to introduce `operator=>`, the implication operator, into the C++ core language.

A new operator! `p => q` is equivalent to `(!p) || q`

[cols="3", options="header"]
|===
|p
|q
|p=>q

|true
|true
|true

|true
|false
|false

|false

|false
|false
|true

Seems like a waste of a good operator. Give me short lambdas!

== Reflection

https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/16lokr1/question_is_sg_7_reflection_still_active/[Reddit: Is Reflection (SG7) still active?]

No, it is not.

== C++ Modules in CMake 3.28

https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/16y9qv2/cmake_c_modules_support_in_328/[Reddit]

> After 5 years its finally done. Next cmake 3.28 release will support cpp modules
C++ 20 named modules are now supported by Ninja Generators and Visual Studio Generators for VS 2022 and newer, in combination with the MSVC 14.34 toolset (provided with VS 17.4) and newer, LLVM/Clang 16.0 and newer, and GCC 14 (after the 2023-09-20 daily bump) and newer.

> the more i look at Cpp2 the less i like the syntax it uses, it is becoming complex really fast
And is great it change/improve some things but the ones i think are a mistake (like the 6 types of arguments for a function) remains so ... This will end in a complex syntax and a complex lang which will be an issue sooner than later https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/16ummo8/cppfront_autumn_update/k2msfya/[↑]

== C++ Modules in Clang

* Experimental
* Relies on a temporary CMake project to build library modules
* Users need to be able to build their own BMI files

OK, that didn't go viral as I'd hoped.
