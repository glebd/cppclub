## WG21 October mailing (cont.)

[Mailing](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/#mailing2022-10) - 80 papers, 41 new!

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/y60pec/wg21_aka_c_standard_committee_october_2022_mailing/)

### New papers

* **Follow-up** [C++ is the next C++](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2657r0.html)
  * [Reddit thread exploded a bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/yjyst3/c_is_the_next_c/) -- curiously, it looks like most commenters didn't actually read the paper but are responding to the catchy title.
    * [Deep in the thread, an interesting comment about Carbon](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/yjyst3/c_is_the_next_c/iuqyr4x/)

* [P2632R0. A plan for better template meta programming facilities in C++26](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2632r0.pdf). Big plans. Separate proposals for each planned feature. Uses [Circle](https://www.circle-lang.org/) by [Sean Baxter](https://twitter.com/seanbax) as an implementation example.
  * [P2662R0. Pack indexing](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2662r0.pdf)
  * [P2671R0. Syntax Choices for Generalized Pack Declaration and Usage](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2671r0.html)
* [P2644R0. Get Fix of Broken Range-based for Loop Finally Done, by Nicolai Josuttis](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2644r0.pdf). A more general fix is not coming, it seems. But we have [P2012](http://wg21.link/P2012). Maybe it is good enough?
* [P2656R0. C++ Ecosystem International Standard](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2656r0.html). Interoperable tools, what a concept.
* [P2658R0. Temporary storage class specifiers](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2657r0.html). More dialects?
* [P2666R0. Last use optimization](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2666r0.pdf)
* [P2668R0. Role based parameter passing](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2668r0.pdf). Parameter attributes like in Cpp2, or automatic parameter handling like in Carbon.
  * [D0708. Parameter passing, by Herb Sutter](https://github.com/hsutter/708/blob/main/708.pdf)
* [P2670R0. Non-transient `constexpr` allocation, by Barry Revzin](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2670r0.html).
* [P2672R0. Exploring the Design Space for a Pipeline Operator, by Barry Revzin](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2672r0.html). The pipeline operator `|>` lives (maybe).
* [P2676R0. The Val Object Model](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2676r0.pdf). Food for thought for a future C++. (David Sankel is at Adobe now, huh.)
* [P2677R0. Reconsidering concepts in-place syntax](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2677r0.pdf). Bring back `auto{T}`!
* [P2688R0. Pattern Matching Discussion for Kona 2022](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2688r0.pdf). Can we have pattern matching in C++26, pretty please? Also, `match` is nicer than `inspect`, IMHO.

### Contracts!!

* [P2659R0. A Proposal to Publish a Technical Specification for Contracts, by Brian Bi, Bloomberg](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2659r0.pdf).
* [P2660R0. Proposed Contracts TS](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2660r0.pdf). [P2661R0. Amendments](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2661r0.pdf). Uses attribute-based contract syntax.
* [P2680R0. Contracts for C++: Prioritizing Safety, by Gabriel Dos Reis](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2680r0.pdf)

## Fast math flag in libraries

Brendan Dolan-Gavitt wrote an article called [_Someone’s Been Messing With My Subnormals!_](https://moyix.blogspot.com/2022/09/someones-been-messing-with-my-subnormals.html), in which he describes an intrusive nature of the GCC/Clang compiler switch `-ffast-math`.

> TL;DR: After noticing an annoying warning, I went on an absurd yak shave, and discovered that because of a tiny handful of Python packages built with an appealing-sounding but dangerous compiler option, more than 2,500 Python packages—some with more than a million downloads per month—could end up causing any program that uses them to compute incorrect numerical results.

The discovery:

> It turns out (somewhat insanely) that when `-ffast-math` is enabled, the compiler will link in a constructor that sets the FTZ/DAZ flags whenever the library is loaded — even on shared libraries, which means that any application that loads that library will have its floating point behavior changed for the whole process. And `-Ofast`, which sounds appealingly like a "make my program go fast" flag, automatically enables `-ffast-math`, so some projects may unwittingly turn it on without realizing the implications.

Also, apparently, if you use `-Ofast`, `-fno-fast-math` does NOT disable the auto-enabled `-ffast-math`! WHAAAAT

The author wrote a Python script ([Gist](https://gist.github.com/moyix/2154125d0cb9947ec0525fb49449fab7)) to check if a library was compiled with `-ffast-math`.

Pretty crazy. Be careful with your math compiler options.

## Twitter: new tech vs. veteran

[DM of Engineering](https://twitter.com/dmofengineering/status/1556387621047132160):

New to tech:
This will totally work.

Tech veteran:
There's no way that works.

[DM of Engineering](https://twitter.com/dmofengineering/status/1556389086725672960):

New to tech:
I’m proud that my code worked on the first try.

Tech Veteran:
I’m suspicious because my code worked on the first try.

[DM of Engineering](https://twitter.com/dmofengineering/status/1556388408078938112):

New to tech:
This code has been running for 2 years, we should rewrite it.

Tech Veteran:
This code has been running for 20 years, I’m starting to feel like maybe we’ve got the bugs out.

[DM of Engineering](https://twitter.com/dmofengineering/status/1556384811467489281):

New to tech:
I am a magician. I create things from pure thought.

Tech Veteran:
I am a plumber.
