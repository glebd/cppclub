## WG21 October mailing

[Mailing](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/#mailing2022-10) - 80 papers, 41 new!

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/y60pec/wg21_aka_c_standard_committee_october_2022_mailing/)

### Updated papers

* [P2000R4. DIRECTION FOR ISO C++](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2000r4.pdf). Additions are highlighted in red, my eyes!! Accent on type safety, static analysis.
* [P0592R5. To boldly suggest an overall plan for C++26, by Ville Voutilainen](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p0592r5.html)
* [P2263R1. A call for a WG21 managed chat service](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2263r1.html). IRC -> Slack (Cpplang) -> Mattermost. CoC enforcement is a problem.
* [P1068R6. Vector API for random number generation](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1068r6.pdf). Doesn't address the problem of correct initialisation of random number generators.
* [P1385R7. A proposal to add linear algebra support to the C++ standard library](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1385r7.pdf). This is a big one, voting record shows various details are being fleshed out.
* [P1673R10. A free function linear algebra interface based on the BLAS](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/#mailing2022-10). Huh, another one? [Interop with the other proposal](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1673r10.html#interoperable-with-other-linear-algebra-proposals). [Distinctive characteristics](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1673r10.html#purpose-of-this-paper).
* [P1967R9. `#embed` - a scannable, tooling-friendly binary resource inclusion mechanism](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1967r9.html). The C edition was accepted into C23. Come on, C++.
* [P2392R2. Pattern matching using `is` and `as`, by Herb Sutter](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2392r2.pdf). Nothing on what's changed in this version. Perhaps Cpp2 had some influence?
* [P2561R1. An error propagation operator, by Barry Revzin (was: `operator??`)](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2561r1.html). Looks a bit weird.

### New papers

* [P2687R0. Design Alternatives for Type-and-Resource Safe C++, by Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Dos Reis](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2687r0.pdf)
* [P2657R0. C++ is the next C++](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2657r0.html). C++ can be improved with static analysis, which can be specified and configured per module. This creates dialects of sorts, but doesn't add or remove anything from C++.
