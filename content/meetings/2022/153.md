# 153. Carbon, WG21, ABI, Books, Build, Packages

## Media

### Video

Coming soon.

### Podcast

Coming soon.

## WG21 August mailing

* [Mailing link](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/#mailing2022-08)
* [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/wuider/wg21_aka_c_standard_committee_august_2022_mailing/)

Papers:

* [P0843R5 `static_vector`](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p0843r5.html) -- proposes a dynamically-resizable vector with compile-time fixed capacity and contiguous embedded storage in which the elements are stored within the vector object itself.
* [P2019R1 Usability improvements for `std::thread`](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2019r1.pdf) -- proposed extending `thread` and `jthread` to allow assigning name and stack size to newly constructed threads.
* [P2635R0 Enhancing the `break` statement](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2635r0.html) -- proposes that `break continue` breaks the inner loop and continues the outer loop.

From an earlier mailing:

* [P2547R1 Language Support for Customisable Functions](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2547r1.html) by Lewis Baker -- seeks to improve over existing customisation-point mechanisms in a number of ways, including introducing a new keyword `customisable` for namespace-level functions and function templates that can be overridden, and can also be `final` and have a `default` implementation. This makes using customisation point objects easier than ADL- or tag_invoke-based customisation solutions.

That's a little dose of C++ optimism for you in case you need it after the previous meeting.

## Carbon reactions

### ADSP Podcast Episode 89: The Carbon Programming Language (Part 2)

[Podcast](https://adspthepodcast.com/2022/08/05/Episode-89.html)

The current Carbon core team -- Chandler Carruth, Kate Gregory, and Richard Smith -- are not "benevolent dictators for life", there will be rotation.

And that was it for Carbon language in this episode.

### C++ Syntax Sucks and Carbon Fixes It

Erik Engheim, a C++ developer from Norway, wrote an article called [_C++ Syntax Sucks and Carbon Fixes It_](https://itnext.io/c-syntax-sucks-and-carbon-fixes-it-744efe5cae71) on his Medium blog (_please don't use Medium, it hides your content behind a paywall_).

A better title would be _C++ Syntax is Hard to Parse and Carbon Syntax Is A Bit Simpler_, but it's not as clickbaity.

The author quotes Jeffrey Hykin, the author of VSCode C++ highlighter plugin, who says:

> The C++ syntax highlighter, at 19,000 lines, is not only the largest of any language but nearly four times larger than the 2nd largest syntax (Typescript at 5,000 lines).

The author writes:

> The problem with C/C++ syntax is that you cannot determine what a statement is until you have parsed several tokens.

Ah, the famous programming language C/C++.

He mentions ['the most vexing parse'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse) where you can't easily distinguish between a function and a variable declaration:

```cpp
int bar(int(x));
```

It's not an issue in Carbon because Carbon classes don't have constructors, and objects are initialised using assignment.

Erik writes:

> One of the most annoying things when writing C++ code is dealing with const correctness and references.

He likes the fact that in Carbon the compiler takes care of choosing the best way to pass parameters to a function, so the programmer doesn't have to think about it. I have a suspicion that we'll end up having to know what the compiler chooses to represent parameters, and thus go back to the C++ situation, only even more confusing.

Erik really likes introducer keywords in Carbon. He says:

> This makes scanning a list of functions or methods quicker in Carbon. Especially languages, such as Java, are terrible in this regard. You read `public static void`, and then you finally get to the important part, which is the method name. C++ is better, but still take focus away from method names by having info about the return values come before the method name.

He says nothing about the modern function declaration syntax in C++ using `auto`, which I'm sure he knows about, but chooses to omit because it's inconvenient for the point he is making. Hmm...

To summarise the article, Carbon doesn't 'improve' C++ syntax but chooses to be different, and that's OK. Yes, C++ syntax is hard to parse, but on the other hand Carbon barely exists at the moment (to the point that Erik had to make assumptions on how it may look based on Rust and Go) and doesn't even have a proper compiler yet. We'll see how Carbon syntax develops.

The Reddit thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wiaggd/how_carbon_fixes_c_syntax/). Some quotes:

> They just wanted the parser to be easier. Most of the syntax is worst for users [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wiaggd/how_carbon_fixes_c_syntax/ijafhqn/)

> Agreed. Maybe it solved some fringe cases, but for 90% of the usage it looks like the syntax has more noise and is harder to read. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wiaggd/how_carbon_fixes_c_syntax/ijarzs2/)

> As of C++11, there is the `auto` keyword, alternative function syntax and aggregate initializers. When you use those, it makes the syntax look a lot like Carbon [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wiaggd/how_carbon_fixes_c_syntax/ijbnkrn/)

> I’ve seen people actually ask “should I learn C++ still, or is it inevitably dying because of Carbon”? And it’s just the silliest thing to even suggest [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wiaggd/how_carbon_fixes_c_syntax/ijbhwis/)

> It's absolutely a control thing. The rest of the C++ standards committee voted against something the Google reps wanted, and they took their toys and went home. Now there's Carbon. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wiaggd/how_carbon_fixes_c_syntax/ijakpor/)

> Given that Carbon was started because, by all appearances, Google lost a single vote in the c++ community and decided to not try again or convince people and reach consensus, but rather hard fork...what will they do in the future if the Carbon community votes against them on some issue? Or is the intention that this is a forever Google dominated project? [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wiaggd/how_carbon_fixes_c_syntax/ijdg5cz/)

### Is it too late to break ABI?

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/)

> Has the ship sailed? Is C++ doomed or do we have a magic solution in the horizon?
>
> A few years ago C++ voted to put performance and ease of use as second priority over breaking ABI. Google stopped its contributions to C++ and Clang. Today, they announced Carbon. <...>
>
> Do we even intend C++ to keep evolving, or we intend for C++ to follow the C path, and prevent evolution in favor of not breaking anything forever? Will an ABI break ever happen? <...>

A question like this usually results in a thread full of rants and venting. Here is my summary of the points raised:

* The committee is useless. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igthebj/)
* Caring so much about ABI cost the Committee contributions of Google employees.
* Those still using C++98 and old compilers should be disregarded. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igthnw9/)
* Old code doesn't deserve new compilers.
* Everybody should compile everything every time from source. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/ih1x6u1/)
* The embedded domain also exists, and compiler upgrade story there is painful. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/ih2c7qq/)
* People are still upset at the C++11 string CoW ABI break. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igvg5xa/) [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igwajvd/)
* People are too obsessed about breaking ABI. It won't solve C++'s problems. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igutcj3/) [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igtwi1l/)
* Backward compatibility is C++'s strength, not weakness. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igvvcmi/) [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igul692/)
* You can just implement your own types. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igtix7g/)
* Epochs would have been great, but are unrelated to ABI. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/igxjugu/)
* The Standard Commitee hasn't banned ABI breaks. What they did however ruled out is introducing changes that mandate them for now. [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/w2zt40/is_it_too_late_to_break_abi/ih2nsas/)
* C++ sucks.
* C++ is great and is not going away.

## Book: Software Engineering at Google

This is the title of the book released by O'Reilly in 2020 and available online if you have an account with them, or you can read it for free [on the web](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/toc.html). Written by Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck and Hyrum Wright, it is:

> <...> about the engineering practices utilized at Google to make their codebase sustainable and healthy.

This book should be useful even if you aren't trying to get a job at Google.

Reading it online could be tricky though due to Google's choice of an extremely thin font. They probably thought that software engineering at Google is so difficult that even reading about it should be as hard as possible. You can always use your browser's reader view, of course.

## Elements of Programming

Alexander Stepanov and Paul McJones made their book _Elements of Programming_ [freely downloadable as a PDF](http://elementsofprogramming.com/), go get it -- it's a classic.

## From C++98 to C++20

Konstantin Burlachenko wrote a long [technical note](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md) outlining changes from C++98 to C++20, which can serve as a refresher for C++ developers. Curiously, he included the following explanation:

> **C/C++**. By C/C++, we mean C or C++ programming languages.

Still, seeing C/C++ throughout the document is a bit _ugh_.

## New string functions in C++20 and C++23

A new C++ [cheatsheet](https://twitter.com/hackingcpp/status/1543273639558127620) from Hacking C++ lists string functions introduced in C++20 and C++23.

{{<tweet user="hackingcpp" id="1543273639558127620">}}

Other languages are giggling uncontrollably.

## Catching sanitizer errors programmatically

[Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/blog/2022/08/20/catching-sanitizer-errors-programmatically/)

void __asan_on_error() {
  std::cout << "You caused an error: " << message << std::endl;
}
}
```

## Synthesizing a C++20 three-way comparison from two-way comparisons

Raymond Chen (Microsoft) wrote an article called [_How can I synthesize a C++20 three-way comparison from two-way comparisons?_](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220516-52/?p=106661) where he discusses the new C++20 `<=>` ('spaceship') operator. He presents a useful table that lists comparison outcomes of a spaceship operator, of which there are five (from a 'three-way comparison operator', which shouldn't surprise you, a C++ programmer, too much).

* For **strong ordering**, the result can be: **less**, **equal**, **equivalent**, **greater**.
* For **weak ordering**, the result can be: **less**, **equivalent**, **greater**.
* For **partial ordering**, the result can be: **less**, **equivalent**, **greater**, **unordered**.

Regarding the difference between 'equal' and 'equivalent', Raymond says:

> For example, two instances of the same string "hello" are equal, in that they represent the same string and are fully interchangeable. On the other hand, two people with the same security clearance are equivalent from a security perspective (they have access to the same things), but they are not equal (they are nevertheless different people).

Raymond states:

> The strong ordering distinguishes between items being equal (identical and interchangeable) and equivalent (not interchangeable but close enough for some purpose).

In the [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ur7zm2/how_can_i_synthesize_a_c20_threeway_comparison/), STL [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ur7zm2/how_can_i_synthesize_a_c20_threeway_comparison/i8vvqlm/) **this is incorrect**, as the standard mandates that:

```cpp
static_assert(std::strong_ordering::equal == std::strong_ordering::equivalent);
```

Raymond continues:

> Suppose you have an object from a class library that predates C++20 and doesn’t support three-way comparison. You want your code to be able to take advantage of the three-way comparison should the library be updated but fall back to two-way comparison in the meantime. In other words, you want to take advantage of three-way comparison if available.

His advice is to use `std::tuple` for comparing objects that don't support equality check and only support `operator<`:

> Tuples have the bonus property of supporting the three-way comparison operator, even if the underlying types do not. In the case where they do not, they will synthesize a three-way comparison from the two-way comparisons.

```cpp
std::weak_ordering
compare_3way_via_tuple(T const& a, T const& b)
{
    return std::forward_as_tuple(a) <=>
           std::forward_as_tuple(b);
}
```

Note that if the type being compared supports `operator==` it will be more efficient to use `std::compare_weak_order_fallback` as it checks for equality first, which is more efficient, and only then falls back to `operator<`.

Interestingly, STL also [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ur7zm2/how_can_i_synthesize_a_c20_threeway_comparison/i98geud/) in the thread that in order to use the spaceship operator it is necessary to include the `<compare>` header, which is a bit weird as now we have an operator (a language feature) that depends on a standard library header.

## CompileScore

Visual Studio extension and standalone app for build times and compilation data visualization.

[GitHub](https://github.com/Viladoman/CompileScore)

Displays compilation cost inline in source files. Uses either MSVC or Clang `-ftime-trace`.

## Debugging coroutines in Clang 15

There is a new article on the [new coroutine debugging facilities](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DebuggingCoroutines.html) in Clang 15. If you're lucky enough to be able to use it, and are working with coroutines, these features could be very helpful.

Quote from the introduction:

> For performance and other architectural reasons, the C++ Coroutines feature in the Clang compiler is implemented in two parts of the compiler. Semantic analysis is performed in Clang, and Coroutine construction and optimization takes place in the LLVM middle-end.
>
> However, this design forces us to generate insufficient debugging information. Typically, the compiler generates debug information in the Clang frontend, as debug information is highly language specific. However, this is not possible for Coroutine frames because the frames are constructed in the LLVM middle-end.
>
> To mitigate this problem, the LLVM middle end attempts to generate some debug information, which is unfortunately incomplete, since much of the language specific information is missing in the middle end.
>
> This document describes how to use this debug information to better debug coroutines.

## Lewis Baker on coroutines

Lewis Baker, who wrote a bulk of coroutine code and the helper library [cppcoro](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro), [tweeted](https://twitter.com/lewissbaker/status/1528563836995125248) a link to [Godbolt](https://www.godbolt.org/z/EoovEEKvW) containing a heavily commented skeleton code for writing coroutine-based code. As you can see, it's pretty long, so if you only want to use pre-built coroutine wrapper classes, use _cppcoro_. But if you need to implement coroutine support from scratch for your own types, this boilerplate code may come handy.

Steve Downey took the code and put it in a [buildable CMake project](https://github.com/steve-downey/coroexample) for convenience.
