## Good news! C++ overtakes Java in Tiobe language popularity index

* [Article](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3682141/c-plus-plus-overtakes-java-in-language-popularity-index.html)

Actually, that doesn't mean anything.

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/zeyynm/c_overtakes_java_in_language_popularity_index/)

[Stephan T. Lavavej](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/zeyynm/c_overtakes_java_in_language_popularity_index/izaax4h/):

> Tiobe is junk information, regardless of whether it seems to be "good" or "bad" news for C++. There's nothing useful about it, nothing that will help people make better decisions. I believe that posts about it should consistently be removed. (That is, "C++ is becoming more popular!" is actually as annoying as "C++ is becoming less popular OMG what ever shall we do", when the measure is distorted beyond any connection to reality.)

Other notable replies were:

* _Rust will overtake C++_, vs. _No it won't_
* _C++ got much nicer with C++17 and C++20, so obviously those who were disgusted by pre-c++17 or even pre-c++11 are coming back to C++_ [↑](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/zeyynm/c_overtakes_java_in_language_popularity_index/iz9yb38/)
* _Only a fool starts a new embedded project using C unless it's for a rare niche platform that doesn't have a working C++ environment. Unfortunately there are still many fools around_ [↑](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/zeyynm/c_overtakes_java_in_language_popularity_index/iza22w1/)
* _Only a fool starts a new embedded project in C++ unless it's for a rare niche platform that doesn't have a working Rust HAL_ [↑](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/zeyynm/c_overtakes_java_in_language_popularity_index/izadzng/)

## Kona trip reports

### Herb Sutter

* [Trip report: Autumn ISO C++ standards meeting (Kona)](https://herbsutter.com/2022/11/12/trip-report-autumn-iso-c-standards-meeting-kona/)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/yti4jp/trip_report_autumn_iso_c_standards_meeting_kona/)

The first hybrid in-person/remote conference went smoothly thanks to Jens Maurer and Dietmar Kühl leading a group of volunteers who trialled this in September.

* Contracts roadmap adopted!
* `std::execution` is coming in C++26!
* `#embed` is coming in C++26!
* C++ Ecosystem International Standard is on! [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ytgm0o/c_ecosystem_international_standard_is_on/)

Next meeting: Issaqua, February 2023.

### Corentin Jabot

* [Soursop and Ponies in Kona: A C++ Committee Trip Report](https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/kona22/)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/z5qlvr/soursop_and_ponies_in_kona_a_c_committee_trip/)

### Follow-up: P2644 Get Fix of Broken Range-based for Loop Finally Done

* [P2644](https://wg21.link/p2644)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1316#issuecomment-1307727665)
* [Wording for P2644R1 Fix for Range-based for Loop](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2718r0.html)

Looks like range-for temporary problem is finally getting fixed in C++23!

## Follow-up: P2632 A plan for better template meta programming facilities in C++26

[P2632](https://wg21.link/p2632)

Kona: no consensus, but an encouragement for more work in this direction. Also, no consensus for pack introducers outside template context.

## Follow-up: P2589 `static operator []`

[P2589R0](https://wg21.link/P2589R0): consensus, forwarded to CWG for inclusion in C++23.

## Mark Russinovich: C++ is deprecated

{{<tweet user="markrussinovich" id="1571995117233504257">}}

Mark is the CTO of Azure and the author of [Windows Sysinternals tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/).

Copying the tweet here in case he decides to delete it later, or Space Karen finally kills Twitter:

> Speaking of languages, it's time to halt starting any new projects in C/C++ and use Rust for those scenarios where a non-GC language is required. For the sake of security and reliability. the industry should declare those languages as deprecated.

Me: _Laughs in C/C++_

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/xiuk3n/cto_of_azure_declares_c_deprecated/)

Liam Tung [disagrees](https://www-zdnet-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/programming-languages-its-time-to-stop-using-c-and-c-for-new-projects-says-microsoft-azure-cto/)

The Register accidentally invokes [Betteridge's Law of Headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) with their article titled [_Is it time to retire C and C++ for Rust in new programs?_](https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/28/is_it_time_to_retire_c/)

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/xm82aw/microsoft_azure_cto_says_its_time_to_stop_using_c/)

## The pool of talented C++ developers is running dry

[Article](https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2022/11/why-is-there-a-drought-in-the-talent-pool-for-c-developers)

A cryptocurrency trading firm can't find good developers, hmmm...

> Where are all the C++ programmers? People are seemingly scared away from the language by a terrible stigma: the notion that it is a legacy program. With big names in tech such as Microsoft Azure CEO Mark Russinovich calling people to “deprecate” C++ “for the sake of security and reliability,” in favour of Rust, this is hardly surprising.

The ending is encouraging:

> The reality is that there are plenty of C++ jobs available in finance, and that compared to other languages there are comparatively few people to fill them. The language may be hard. But it's also worth it.

[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/yk6leu/the_pool_of_talented_c_developers_is_running_dry/):

> I know I retired recently, but didn't expect it to have such an impact. But seriously, companies having trouble attracting people might want to look at what they are offering. Perhaps cheap and talented C++ developers are hard to find? [↑](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/yk6leu/the_pool_of_talented_c_developers_is_running_dry/iurjida/)

In the thread there is a long [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/yk6leu/the_pool_of_talented_c_developers_is_running_dry/iuuczxa/) about interviewing practices at the company the article author works for, and oh boy. Maybe their problem lies elsewhere?

More in the same site: [C++ is the new Python](https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2021/07/modern-c-finance-jobs) -- a weird title, but the article says that C++ is making a comeback. _Didn't know it was gone._

An amusing older article is titled [The world's top C++ programmer. And what he does at Morgan Stanley](https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2020/12/bjarne-stroustrup-morgan-stanley). Calling Bjarne Stroustrup 'a C++ programmer' is like calling Tim Berners-Lee 'a web designer'.
