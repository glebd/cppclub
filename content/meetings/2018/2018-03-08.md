# Meeting 8 March 2018

## C++ Developer Survey "Lite" 2018-02 Results

[PDF](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/CppDevSurvey-2018-02-summary.pdf)

## Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6 released

* [Release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes)
* [C++ improvements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#CPlusPlus)

## Chrome switches to Clang on Windows, ditches MSVC

* [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/chrome-on-windows-ditches-microsofts-compiler-now-uses-clang/)
* [LLVM Blog](http://blog.llvm.org/2018/03/clang-is-now-used-to-build-chrome-for.html)

> Building Chrome locally with Clang is about 15% slower than with MSVC.

## Accio Dependency Manager, by Corentin Jabot

## East const

* [Jon Kalb](http://slashslash.info/2018/02/a-foolish-consistency/)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/80k8hc/a_blog_rant_on_east_const/)

> `const` modifies what is on its left. Unless there is nothing on its left, in which case it modifies what’s on its right.

* [CppCoreGuidelines NL.26: Use conventional `const` notation](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#nl26-use-conventional-const-notation). Reason: Conventional notation is more familiar to more programmers. Consistency in large code bases.

## C++: Thoughts on Dealing with Signed/Unsigned Mismatch

* [IT Hare](http://ithare.com/c-thoughts-on-dealing-with-signedunsigned-mismatch/)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/82hmsc/c_thoughts_on_dealing_with_signedunsigned_mismatch/)
* [Previously on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/7y0o6r/is_it_a_good_practice_to_use_unsigned_values/)

> Matters discussed here are related to mitigation of certain decisions which were made 50+ years ago and which are pretty much carved in stone now.
>
> Developers, while trying to get rid exactly of signed/unsigned warning, turned a perfectly-working-program-with-warnings, into a program-without-warnings-but-which-fails-once-a-day-or-so.

## Stealth features responsible for half of F-35 defects

> <...> so-called quality escapes — errors made by Lockheed’s workforce that could include drilling holes that are too big or installing a dinged part

## C++ Metaprogramming

* [Reddit question](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/82nbdv/c_metaprogramming/)
* Book: [C++ Templates: The Complete Guide, 2nd ed, by Vandervoorde, Josuttis, Gregor](https://www.amazon.com/C-Templates-Complete-Guide-2nd/dp/0321714121)

> The main "rule" when doing template metaprogramming is, "if the value yield by such an expression is non-sensical, this function / class / etc... is skipped"

C++:

```cpp
template <
    typename T
  , std::enable_if_t<
      std::negation_v<
        std::conjunction<
            std::is_arithmetic<T>::type
          , std::is_same<T, QStringList>::type
        >
      >
    >* = nullptr>
QDataStream& operator>>(QDataStream& stream, T& obj);
```

Lisp:

```lisp
(enable_if
   (not
    (and
     (is_arithmetic T)
     (is_same T QStringList)
    )
   )
  )
```

## Non-virtual destructors

* [Post](https://blog.knatten.org/2018/03/02/non-virtual-destructors/)

```cpp
struct B {
  B() { std::cout << 'b'; }
  ~B() { std::cout << 'B'; }
};
struct D : B {
  D() { std::cout << 'd'; }
  ~D() { std::cout << 'D'; }
};
int main() {
  B* p = new D;
  delete p;
}
```

* [Herb Sutter's GotW #5](https://herbsutter.com/2013/05/22/gotw-5-solution-overriding-virtual-functions/) -- "base’s destructor should be virtual or protected."

## `shared_ptr` reference count for `nullptr`

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48885252/c-sharedptr-use-count-for-nullptr)

```cpp
shared_ptr<int> sptr2(nullptr);
cout << "sptr2 use_count: " << sptr2.use_count() << endl;

shared_ptr<int> sptr6(nullptr, default_delete<int>());
cout << "sptr6 use_count: " << sptr6.use_count() << endl;
```

Output:

```
sptr2 use_count: 0
sptr6 use_count: 1
```
