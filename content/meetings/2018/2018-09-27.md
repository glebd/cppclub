## Use the official Boost.Hana with MSVC 2017 Update 8 compiler

* [Post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/08/30/use-the-official-boost-hana-with-msvc-2017-update-8-compiler/)

> Today, we’re happy to announce that the vcpkg version of Boost.Hana now just points to the official master repo, instead of our fork.

## VS2017 15.9: Step Back – Going Back in C++ Time

* [Post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/09/26/step-back-going-back-in-c-time/)

> In the most recent, 15.9, update to Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise Edition, we’ve added “Step Back” for C++ developers targeting Windows 10 Anniversary Update (1607) and later. With this feature, you can now return to a previous state while debugging without having to restart the entire process.

## Catch 2.4.0

* [Release](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases)
    * Added experimental support for data generators
    * Added support for compiling and running Catch without exceptions
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9cusci/c_test_framework_catch_24_released/)
    * [Why CATCH?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9cusci/c_test_framework_catch_24_released/e5duco3/)

## `std::optional`: How, when, and why

    * [Reddit 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9dtr4e/c_is_subtle_and_complex_scott_meyers_no_longer/)

> I no longer plan to update my books to fix technical errors.

## Lifetime Profile by Herb Sutter

* [Blog post](https://herbsutter.com/2018/09/20/lifetime-profile-v1-0-posted/)
    * Includes Godbolt links to try it out using an experimental Clang-based implementation
* [CppCon 2015 talk at 29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEx5DNLWGgA&feature=youtu.be&t=29m6s)
* [PDF](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/docs/Lifetime.pdf)

> <This paper> shows how to efficiently diagnose many common cases of dangling (use-after-free) in C++ code, using only local analysis to report them as deterministic readable errors at compile time.

## C++ Now 2018: Compile Fast, Run Faster, Scale Forever: A look into the **sol** Lua library, by JeanHeyd Meneide

{{<youtube 0Lwy4_sKeJM>}}

* [sol2 on GitHub](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) (MIT, but will become Apache 2), [Docs](http://sol2.rtfd.io/), [Tutorials](http://sol2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/all-the-things.html), [Examples](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2/tree/develop/examples)
    * Used in: databases (Redis), OS components, games and game engines, HPC, GUI scripting (Waze, OpenMPT), chat servers etc.
    * Written on top of Lua C API
* Soon: paper on `std::optional<T&>` (rebind on assignment)
* Soon: sol3

## What can C++ do for embedded systems developers? - Bjarne Stroustrup

{{<youtube id="VoHOLDdfDhk" title="NDC TechTown - August 2018 - Keynote">}}

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9ih67q/what_can_c_do_for_embedded_systems_developers/)
* Most people in the audience use C++ alone or with C and other languages for embedded development
* Grace Hopper is the grandmother of COBOL
* Zero overhead doesn't mean zero cost
* Use predictable subset of C++ for small safety-critical systems (no dynamic memory)
* Allocate at startup, use as a pool, don't ever free (memory fragmentation)
* Unpredictable: `new`/`malloc`, `throw`, RTTI, standard containers, `std::function`

## Crash course in Qt for C++ developers

* [Start of the series](https://www.cleanqt.io/blog/crash-course-in-qt-for-c%2B%2B-developers,-part-1)
    * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9f00em/crash_course_in_qt_for_c_developers_a_blog_post/)

## Range-based for over a struct object

* [Post](https://mklimenko.github.io/english/2018/09/01/range-based-for-struct/)
* [magic_get library (GitHub)](https://github.com/apolukhin/magic_get)

```cpp
struct {
    std::uint32_t fw_version = 0;
    std::uint16_t sector_0_version = 0;
    std::string id = "";
    std::array<std::uint8_t, 6> options{};
} data;

boost::pfr::for_each_field(std::forward<decltype(data)>(data), [](auto&& val)
{
    Process(val);
});

```

## Non-Virtual Destructors, by Anders Knatten (CppQuiz)

[Post](https://blog.knatten.org/2018/03/02/non-virtual-destructors/)

§5.3.5/3 in the C++11 standard:

> If the static type of the object to be deleted is different from its dynamic type, the static type shall be a base class of the dynamic type of the object to be deleted and the static type shall have a virtual destructor or the behavior is undefined.

[Blog: C++ on a Friday](https://blog.knatten.org/)

## Quote on OOP

Joe Armstrong, creator of Erlang:

> You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.
