## Your own type predicate in C++11

[Post](https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/your-own-type-predicate/)

A gentle intro to metaprogramming, metafunctions and type traits.

```cpp
static_assert(is_acceptable<X>::value,
              "X does not have a desired interface");

template <typename... T>
using void_t = void;
```

## `std::launder` - Réka Kovács - Lightning Talks Meeting C++ 2017

{{<youtube id="5HXCbLilIzs" title="`std::launder` - Réka Kovács">}}

```cpp
#include <new>
struct X { const int n; double m; }
int main() {
    X p{3, 8.8};
    new (&p) X{5, 7.7};
    int b = std::launder(&p)->n; // 5
    double c = p.m; // UB!
}
```

## CppCon 2017: Lars Knoll - Qt as a C++ Framework: History, Present State and Future

{{<youtube id="YWiAUUblD34" title="Lars Knoll - Qt as a C++ Framework: History, Present State and Future">}}

Comments are divided:

* "A good presentation, lots of people use Qt"
* "This is more of an ad than a talk, why do we waste our time?"
* "I really hate how they try to hide that Qt is free for commercial development"
* "Qt is more and more a dead end in GUI development. It's not done like this anymore. Use Qt for basic operations of your common code but move to the platform specific code for GUI. They look so ugly now and even GTK is better than Qt."
* "`new` - this is why your library is so bad. Just stop."

## A C++ Hello World And the Cute Heartless Rainbow

* [Part 2](https://hackernoon.com/a-c-hello-world-and-the-cute-heartless-rainbow-3cc9695f4142)

## Quotes

Unknown:

> Java: write once, run away.

Unknown from Twitter:

> Debuggers don't remove bugs. They only show them in slow motion.

## Twitter

Jon Purdy @whyevernotso:

> People who deeply understand C++ are great to have on a team---not for their knowledge of C++, but for their ability to accept, cope with, and pragmatically manage things that other people would balk at and call insane, bug-prone, abject horrors.

Slava Pestov @slava_pestov, Apple Swift programmer:

> This is very true, but there are like five people who deeply understand C++
