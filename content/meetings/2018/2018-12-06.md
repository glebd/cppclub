## Who is STL? I mean the person, not the library

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9mwtcm/who_is_stl_i_mean_the_person_not_the_library/)

> Hey. I’m Stephan T. Lavavej (“Steh-fin Lah-wah-wade”), and I’ve worked on MSVC’s STL since 2007. I’ve also worked on several Standard proposals that were accepted (notably the transparent operator functors). I filmed a bunch of videos for MS’s Channel 9 years ago, introducing various Core Language and Standard Library topics, and I’ve given talks at C++Now (formerly BoostCon) and CppCon which have been recorded.

## Real world problems with `#pragma once`?

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/a14o5q/real_world_problems_with_pragma_once/)

> No.

Corentin Jabot:

> Pragma once leads to UB if part of the sources are visible from several included paths which are hardlink of each others.
>
> Good. If you do that, you deserve to suffer!

## Visual C++ Team Blog - `std::any`: How, when, and why

[Post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/10/04/stdany-how-when-and-why/)

> When you need to store an object of an arbitrary type, pull std::any out of your toolbox. Be aware that there are probably more appropriate tools available when you do know something about the type to be stored.
