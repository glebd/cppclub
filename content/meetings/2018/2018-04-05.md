## April Fools, C++ edition

No, I'm not going to link to that.

## STL on Twitter

[#](https://twitter.com/StephanTLavavej/status/980190720907649024) MSVC’s STL is 99% C++17 feature complete! In VS 2017 15.7, we’re shipping Filesystem, Parallel Algorithms (all signatures available, many actually parallelized, more later), `constexpr char_traits` (for `string_view`), Special Math, `hypot(x, y, z)`, `launder()`, and Deduction Guides.

[#](https://twitter.com/StephanTLavavej/status/980192847029661697) 15.7 will contain a partial implementation of Elementary String Conversions in `<charconv>`: integers only. The floating-point part is the last STL feature that needs to be implemented. We’re also almost done with LWG issues: 33 added in 15.7, 14 done in future branches, 15 remain.

## CLion 2018.1 released

* Better C++17 support
* Support for Clang-tidy configuration files
* Produce Linux binaries on Windows
* Built-in Valgrind memcheck in WSL
* Open single file/folder without CMake
* Breadcrumbs in the editor
* Partial Git commits
* Support for Rust, Fortran, Objective-C/C++

## True parallelism, with no concept of threads - Alfred Bratterud - Meeting C++ 2017

{{<youtube id="9IXivbSA_5A" title="True parallelism, with no concept of threads - Alfred Bratterud">}}

* [IncludeOS](http://www.includeos.org/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS)

Fibers, green threads, channels, lightweight processes, coroutines, pthreads - there are lots of options for parallelism abstractions. But what do you do if you just want your application to run a specific task on a specific core on your machine? In IncludeOS we have proper multicore support allowing you to do just that in C++: assign a task - for instance a lambda - directly to an available CPU. <...> In this talk we’ll <...> explore how direct per-core processing can be combined with threading concepts like C++14 fibers or coroutines, without taking away from the simplicity of getting work done uninterrupted.

Conclusions:

* You don't need classical threads to utilize CPU cores
    * Fibers and coroutines can run directly on them
* A pthreads backend requires true blocking
    * Might require fibers, yielding directly to scheduler
* Coroutines TS beats the simplest stack switch
* Stackful coroutines would replace our fibers
* Expect more multicore magic from IncludeOS

## SwedenCpp - Arvid Norberg: Integers in C++

{{<youtube id="y_0KTXuSOJ4" title="Arvid Norberg: Integers in C++">}}

* [How undefined signed overflow enables optimizations in GCC](https://kristerw.blogspot.se/2016/02/how-undefined-signed-overflow-enables.html)
* Guidelines for integers:
    * Signed: when you need normal arithmetic
    * Unsigned: flags, IDs, enumerations (`enum class`), bits
    * Avoid viral promotion of unsigned types wider than `int`
    * Avoid implicit sign conversions: `-Wsign-conversion -Werror`

```cpp
int32_t a = -1; uint32_t b = 1;
if (a > b) std::cout << "wat"; // `a` --> 0xffffffff
```

    * Program order versus memory order
    * Atomic operations
    * Barriers

* Requires GCC 5.9+, VS2015.5+, Boost 1.55+, CMake 3.3.2+

> HPX is a general purpose parallel C++ runtime system for applications of any scale. It implements all of the related facilities as defined by the C++ Standard. <...> HPX provides the only widely available open-source implementation of the new C++17 parallel algorithms. Additionally, HPX implements <...> large parts of the C++ Concurrency TS, task blocks, data-parallel algorithms, executors, index-based parallel for loops, and many more.

## As a C++ developer I think that Rust is...

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/84z9a3/as_a_c_developer_i_think_that_rust/)

* is a good language but the community is toxic towards people not using Rust
* lacks function overloading, value generics, variadic generics and exceptions
* is much nicer, though I doubt I'll get to use it in my current job any time soon
* solves a non-problem if you use modern C++
* is a topic way too often spawning on this C++ subreddit
* would have been a compelling alternative if it came out 10 years ago
* lacks library support
* less powerful but more user-friendly than C++
