== How often do you create memory leak or segfault bugs with modern C++?

https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/16nfksr/how_often_do_you_create_memory_leak_or_segfault/[Reddit]

> Memory leaks - pretty much never. RAII takes care of those way too well for them to happen. The only time I may make them is if I have a resource that I simply don't know I have to cleanup.
Segfaults - I do sometimes make them, particularly during development. They are much more likely when I interface with very low level code (e.g. OS APIs or other low-level libraries), which tends to have many pointers and/or poor type safety. In high level code I make them much less commonly.
Overall, I personally don't find memory management in C++ to be too troublesome. https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/16nfksr/how_often_do_you_create_memory_leak_or_segfault/k1e2sam/[↑]

The moment your program contains UB, all bets are off.

Even if it's just one little UB.

Even if it's never executed.

Even if you don't know it's there at all.

Thinking of using this next time when I have to prove that my UB fix is actually necessary.

== Boost: good or bad?

From Reddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/18pioj9/annoyed_with_overuse_of_boost_in_c_discussionsrant/[Annoyed with Overuse of Boost in C++ Discussions]

> For instance, I was recently exploring Interprocess, only to find out I needed Boost.Date, which led me to implement it myself rather than dealing with the extra dependency.

Ah yes, a date library, famously easy to implement. (OK, they used a **std::chrono** wrapper, but still.)

> And in your lack of experience, you committed a cardinal sin of programming. NEVER write your own datetime implementation unless you are prepared to dedicate a team to maintain it. Time zones are impossible, leap seconds will screw you, and numerous other pitfalls await. It's almost always a terrible idea. Use a library that gets tons of real world use and debugging. https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/18pioj9/annoyed_with_overuse_of_boost_in_c_discussionsrant/keth1qx/[↑]

> Boost is now modular you don’t need to build the full Boost Set of libraries + with vcpkg it is straightforward : i don’t understand why people try to reimplement sub parts of Boost in worse way. Sometime you can find better libraries than the Boost ones and that perfect, but imo Boost is the first to be tried. https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/18pioj9/annoyed_with_overuse_of_boost_in_c_discussionsrant/keq84wr/[↑]

> We here use boost extensively, both server and embedded. Honestly I don’t know what all the fuss is about. It’s excellent code, well maintained by top folks in the c++ world. If you don’t like it, don’t use it. But don’t whine when other people do. https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/18pioj9/annoyed_with_overuse_of_boost_in_c_discussionsrant/keosn2x/[↑]

== Mastodon: preventing implicit conversions

https://mastodon.social/@ohunt/112294336934673348

Oliver Hunt:

I was today years old when I discovered you can stop implicit bool->int conversion in APIs where it causes problems by doing

[source,cpp]
----
int foo(int) {...}
int foo(bool) = delete;
----

Despite knowing this is a valid syntax it never occurred to me you could use it this way, and I did not realize you can do this for free functions O_o

[quote,Andreas Gohr https://octodon.social/@splitbrain]

I really think debugging should be taught in school. Not for any programming language. Kids should learn how to systematically approach a problem, gather diagnostic, follow cause and effect and how to communicate the problem to others. Regardless if this is computer stuff, plumbing or social sciences.
