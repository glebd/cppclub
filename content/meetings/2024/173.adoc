=== Software industry regulation

Robert:

> you quote a prediction regarding regulation on software engineering, and then ridicule it with a laughing track. A laughing track, like we were watching a sitcom! This was really undignified. Especially, since I assess the prediction to have some truth to it: It is already starting to happen. Customers start putting pressure on software developers to follow rules and fulfill regulatory reguirements, so they won't be liable if the software they bought causes damages.

Having worked as a consultant in many large firms over the years, I've seen things. Code written by contractors who don't give two shits about quality of their work (current place being a rare exception). The entire defective and badly designed systems produced by outsourced programmers ruining peoples' lives (like the UK Post Office defective Horizon system produced by Fujitsu where software bugs were ignored and covered up, https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252509066/Fujitsu-escaped-huge-lawsuit-because-Post-Office-behaved-so-badly-in-Horizon-scandal[have a read]). This has been happening for many years and is still happening. And just wait for the onslaught of AI-generated code containing subtle bugs. So forgive me if I'm not too optimistic here.

=== Swift as C++ successor

https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1c425x6/c_club_171_wg21_tokyo_next_30_years_wh_safety/kzna2pt/[Redditor pjmlp on Swift as C++ successor]:

____
Regarding their Swift's remark, it is straight there in Apple's official documentation, and 2023 talks by Apple employees.

> Swift is a successor to the C, C++, and Objective-C languages. It includes low-level primitives such as types, flow control, and operators. It also provides object-oriented features such as classes, protocols, and generics, giving Cocoa and Cocoa Touch developers the performance and power they demand.

> <...> the narrative of C++ as inherently unsafe oversimplifies the situation. The language has undergone substantial evolution, with modern iterations emphasizing safer memory practices without compromising the language’s core principles of efficiency and control.

> The journey toward making C\++ a safer language is complex and fraught with challenges. However, the discussions and proposals led by Stroustrup and supported by the broader C++ community suggest a forward path that respects the language’s legacy while addressing the pressing needs of modern computing.

> Right now, many of the articles about modern C\++ and memory safe C++ end up preaching to the choir. The advice doesn’t reach all corners of industry, and many places in academia are stuck in their ways. If you go to small CS programs at small schools, you will frequently find people learning C\++ as C++ 98 or C+\+03, so they see C++ as “C with Classes and Templates” or “Java without a GC”. https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1bnd5aj/looking_for_pointers_the_c_memory_safety_debate/kwhft2g/[↑]

== Why Rust isn't killing C++

https://societysbackend.com/p/why-rust-isnt-killing-c[Society's Backend] (_Great website name!_) by Logan Thorneloe, an ML engineer at Google.

> <...> the internet likes to perpetuate the myth that C\++ is a soon-to-be-dead language. I’ve seen many people say not to learn C++ because Rust can do basically everything C\++ can do but is much easier to work with and almost guaranteed to be memory safe. This narrative is especially harmful for new developers who focus primarily on what languages they should gain experience in. This causes them to write off C++ which I think is a huge mistake because it’s actually one of the _best_ languages for new developers to learn.

> Learning Rust is an interesting experience, because while many things initially feel like "this is a special problem only I'm having", later one realizes that there's a few fundamental patterns that are universal, and that everyone learning has to re-discover and internalize in order to be productive. <...> there is an overwhelming force in the Rust community that when anyone mentions they're having problems with Rust the language on a fundamental level, the answer is "you just don't get it yet, I promise once you get good enough things will make sense" <...> _The problem you're having is only a problem because you haven't tried hard enough._

> Without adequate limitation on undefined behavior in the evaluation of contract assertions, Microsoft considers the Contracts facility not viable in the contemporary environments where C++ is used.

> Contracts facility that fails to adequately support efficient use with virtual functions and pointer to functions is woefully inadequate and unready for prime use, and inclusion in C++26
in particular. Microsoft recommends against the inclusion of P2900R6 in C++26.

=== A framework for Profiles development

https://wg21.link/p3274r0 by Bjarne Stroustrup

=== Undefined and erroneous behaviour are contract violations

https://wg21.link/p3100r0 by Timur Doumler et al.

> In this paper, we propose to specify undefined behaviour that manifests at runtime to be a contract violation.

> Our proposed framework replaces the concept of erroneous behaviour introduced in https://wg21.link/P2795R5[P2795R5] and paves the way for a safer and more secure C++ Standard.

> As we will show in this paper, the semantics provided by erroneous behaviour are essentially a subset of the semantics that the Contracts framework provides. We can therefore entirely subsume erroneous behaviour into contract violation handling.

This makes C++ safety and UB handling dependent on Contracts, which I thought was an opt-in feature? With this proposal we seem to get automatic implicit contracts everywhere. Not sure I like this. Especially given how contentious the Contracts feature is in the Committee.

=== An alternate proposal for naming contract semantics

https://wg21.link/p3238r0 by Ville Voutilainen

____
The current naming of contract semantics more or less follows the form

<...> the trueness of a predicate

and we use the words 'ignore', 'enforce', 'observe', and ostensibly, 'quick_enforce' for the blank.
This proposal suggests that we should use the form

A contract violation is treated as <...>

and that we use the words 'ignored', 'enforced', 'observed' and 'erroneous' for the blank.
____

And here is an UNO reverse card:

> The more significant part proposed here is that a contract with the semantic where a contract violation causes instant termination without calling a violation handler is simply treated as Erroneous Behavior, with the "fallback" defined behavior being calling the violation handler.

=== Contracts for C++

https://wg21.link/p2900r7 by Joshua Berne, Timur Doumler, Andrzej Krzemieński

____
* The _observe_ semantic will invoke the contract-violation handler; if the contract-violation handler returns normally, program execution will continue from the point of evaluation of the contract assertion.
* The _enforce_ semantic will invoke the contract-violation handler; if the contract-violation handler returns normally, the program is terminated in an implementation-defined fashion.
* The _quick_enforce_ semantic will not invoke the contract-violation handler, but instead immediately terminate the program in an implementation-defined fashion.

== How often do you create memory leak or segfault bugs with modern C++?

https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/16nfksr/how_often_do_you_create_memory_leak_or_segfault/[Reddit]

> Memory leaks - pretty much never. RAII takes care of those way too well for them to happen. The only time I may make them is if I have a resource that I simply don't know I have to cleanup.
Segfaults - I do sometimes make them, particularly during development. They are much more likely when I interface with very low level code (e.g. OS APIs or other low-level libraries), which tends to have many pointers and/or poor type safety. In high level code I make them much less commonly.
Overall, I personally don't find memory management in C++ to be too troublesome. https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/16nfksr/how_often_do_you_create_memory_leak_or_segfault/k1e2sam/[↑]
