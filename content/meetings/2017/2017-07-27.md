## Thoughts on Metaclasses - Herb Sutter - Keynote [ACCU 2017]

{{<youtube id="6nsyX37nsRs" title="Thoughts on Metaclasses - Herb Sutter - Keynote [ACCU 2017]">}}

[Post](https://herbsutter.com/2017/07/26/metaclasses-thoughts-on-generative-c/)

* Depends on:
    * C++17
    * concepts (C++20)
    * `constexpr`, `if constexpr`
    * compile-time meta-programming (P0589, P0633)
    * reflection (P0194, P0385, P0578, P0590, P0598)
* Start watching at 18m

Reflection

```cpp
$T, $expr
```

Compile-time programming

```cpp
constexpr {
    for (auto m: $T.variables())
        if (m.name() == "xyzzy")
            -> { int plugh; }
}
```

## `pystring` by Sony ImageWorks

[GitHub](https://github.com/imageworks/pystring)

> Pystring is a collection of C++ functions which match the interface and behavior of python's string class methods using `std::string`. Implemented in C++, it does not require or make use of a python interpreter. It provides convenience and familiarity for common string operations not included in the standard C++ library. It's also useful in environments where both C++ and python are used.

Overlapping functionality (such as `index` and `slice`/`substr`) of `std::string` is included to match python interfaces.

## Modern C++ Design reloaded - Odin Holmes [ACCU 2017]

{{<youtube id="jkjXIh3E9v0" title="Modern C++ Design reloaded - Odin Holmes [ACCU 2017]">}}

* This is an "update" to the book "Modern C++ Design" by Andrei Alexandrescu
* Discusses updated template metaprogramming techniques:
    - policy-based class design;
    - replacing multiple templates with variadic templates.

## "Concept"-based polymorphism
