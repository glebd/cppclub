# Meeting 9 November 2017

## CppCon 2017 Trip Report by KDAB

[Blog post](http://www.kdab.com/cppcon-2017-trip-report/)

## Catch2

* [Announcement](http://www.levelofindirection.com/journal/2017/11/3/catch2-released.html)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)

New:

* Requires C++11
* Clara: a composable command line processor, [GitHub](https://github.com/philsquared/Clara), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od4bjLfwI-A)
* Commas in assertions

```cpp
REQUIRE( getPair() == std::pair<true, "banana">() );
```

* Microbenchmarking (experimental)

Future plans

* Threading
* Generators/[property-based testing](http://hypothesis.works/articles/what-is-property-based-testing/)

## Transwarp

*Transwarp* is a header-only C++ library for task concurrency. It enables you to free your functors from explicit threads and transparently manage dependencies. Under the hood, a directed acyclic graph is built that allows for efficient traversal and type-safe dependencies. Use *transwarp* if you want to model your dependent operations in a graph of tasks and intend to invoke the graph more than once (MIT).

* [GitHub](https://github.com/bloomen/transwarp)

## Don’t use C++ auto?

[Article](http://swdevmastery.com/dont-use-c-auto-restricting-auto-is-not-the-best-decision-for-your-company-and-it-is-unfair-to-your-developers-instead-train-them-on-how-to-use-it/)

## Optimizing software in C++, by Agner Fog

[PDF](http://agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf)

> This manual is for advanced programmers and software developers who want to make their software faster. It is assumed that the reader has a good knowledge of the C++ programming language and a basic understanding of how compilers work.

> The recommendations are based on the x86 family of microprocessors from Intel, AMD and VIA including the 64-bit versions.

## ULID: Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier

* [GitHub](https://github.com/alizain/ulid)
* [C++](https://github.com/suyash/ulid) --- header-only, MIT
* 128-bit compatibility with UUID
* 1.21e+24 unique ULIDs per millisecond
* Lexicographically sortable!
* Canonically encoded as a 26 character string, as opposed to the 36 character UUID
* Uses Crockford's *base32* for better efficiency and readability (5 bits per character)
* Case insensitive
* No special characters (URL safe)
* Monotonic sort order (correctly detects and handles the same millisecond)

## Ctla: Compile-time linear algebra in C++

[GitHub](https://github.com/moroneyt/ctla) (MIT)

* Header-only library
* All functions `constexpr`, all computation done at compile time
* Intuitive syntax for initialisation, indexing, augmenting
* Matrix arithmetic including inverses and linear systems supported
* Block matrices supported
* Runtime printing in MATLAB-compatible syntax if required

## Static-regexp by Hana Dusíková

[GitHub](https://github.com/hanickadot/static-regexp-old) (MIT)

Very fast regexp using C++11 templates.

## Timertt 1.2.0: A library for working with timers

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/792y88/timertt120_a_lightweight_headeronly_c11_library/)
* [Source](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/sobjectizer/repo/tags/timertt/1.2.0/) (BSD-3-Clause)

* Header-only, C++11

## Pacific++ Conference in New Zealand

* [Trip report](https://kirit.com/Blog:/2017-10-31/Pacific++%20trip%20report)
* [Pacific++ Conference Website](https://pacificplusplus.com/) (Christchurch, New Zealand)
* [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrRR5mU5aqvtZAuEGYfdTjw/videos)

## CppCon 2017: Barbara Geller & Ansel Sermersheim - Unicode Strings: Why the Implementation Matters

{{<youtube id="ysh2B6ZgNXk" title="Barbara Geller & Ansel Sermersheim - Unicode Strings: Why the Implementation Matters">}}

* Unicode introduction
* You cannot interpret a sequence of characters without knowing the encoding
* `std::string` or `std::wstring` have no way to specify encoding
* MFC, Java, C#, QT: UCS-2, UTF-16
* .NET `TextField` length is specified in storage units => can crash .NET runtime
* [CsString](https://github.com/copperspice/cs_string)

## CsString

A library providing Unicode-aware string support for C++.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/copperspice/cs_string) (BSD 2-clause)
* [Docs](http://www.copperspice.com/docs/cs_string/namespace_cs_string.html)
* Header-only, C++11
* Separates encoding from storage
* Extensively tested
* Part of [CopperSpice](https://github.com/copperspice)
