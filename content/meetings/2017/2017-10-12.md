# Meeting 12 October 2017

## More CppCon 2017 trip reports

* [Isabella Muerte](https://izzys.casa/posts/cppcon-2017-trip-report.html)
    * "I came to the conclusion that the Modules TS needs more scrutiny and is in dire need of fixing, or we're all going to regret it."
* [Jens Weller of Meeting C++](https://www.meetingcpp.com/blog/items/A-CppCon-2017-trip-report.html)

## Facebook and Modules TS in GCC

* [Post](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Facebook-GCC-CXX-Modules)
* GCC's C++ module system will not be ready for next year's GCC 8 release, meaning GCC 9 in 2019 at the earliest.

## Millennials Are Killing The Modules TS, by Isabella Muerte

[Post](https://izzys.casa/posts/millennials-are-killing-the-modules-ts.html)

* There are many incompatible notions on how modules should work (_and this post is one of them, it seems_)
* Without support of build tools modules are dead
* Compiler should not become build system
* We will have interface modules, and implementation modules (?)
* The entire goal is to give users a guaranteed exported interface. There is no module hierarchy (?), no guaranteed single file module implementation, no de facto way of finding a module.
* Members on the committee cannot even agree as to what a module is.
* What does `extern module` do???

### Reddit on "Millennials Are Killing The Modules TS"

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/75eqal/millennials_are_killing_the_modules_ts/)

* A terrible title
* A lot of hand-waiving as well as statements ranging from unsubstantiated to factually incorrect
* Compiler can be a build system to the extent that it already is with header files
* Andrew Sutton: "I am not suggesting that there are not real development problems. I am simply saying that this knee-jerk criticism of and raging against the Modules TS is totally without merit on the basis that the Modules TS is limited in the kinds of problems it can solve."

## Antoine Tran Tan - Extending C++ with Co-Array semantics

{{<youtube id="XM8A8HUGwAY" title="Antoine TRAN TAN - Extending C++ with Co-Array semantics">}}

Co-arrays are a Fortran standard extension implementing Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model.

* [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD)
* [PGAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitioned_global_address_space)
* Non-Uniform Memory Access ([NUMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access))
* Async programming

## CppCon 2017: Stephen Dewhurst - Modern C++ Interfaces: Complexity, Emergent Simplicity, SFINAE, and Second Order Properties of Types

{{<youtube id="PFdWqa68LmA" title="Stephen Dewhurst - Modern C++ Interfaces: Complexity, Emergent Simplicity, SFINAE, and Second Order Properties of Types">}}

* "Most good bugs are team efforts"
* `constexpr if` in C++17 + return type deduction in C++14 allows greater flexibility
* Years ago policy-based design moved implementation details to interface users
* Recently, the shift is back to interface implementers
* SFINAE-based interface design: increased C++ complexity means we're embedding our judgment into our interfaces
* C++ is so complex now that it's actually becoming simpler due to convention, idiom, embedded experience, and DWIM interfaces

## "Making new friends" idiom by Dan Saks

[Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Making_New_Friends)

The goal is to simplify creation of friend functions for a class template.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T& t) { value = t; }
   friend ostream& operator <<(ostream& os, const Foo<T>& b)
   {
      return os << b.value;
   }
};
```

## Godbolting your C++ code

## Kevlin Henney - Functional C++

{{<youtube id="mlkE8EJZODw" title="Kevlin Henney - Functional C++">}}

* C++ is copy-based, Java is reference-based
* Const correctness
* Value types
* Builder pattern for value types
* Persistent data structures

## In-place containers for fun and profit

[Blog post by David Gross](http://david-grs.github.io/inplace_containers_for_fun_and_profit/)

The idea behind `inplace_string` is to get a full replacement of C++17â€™s `std::string`, with an in-place memory storage.

The underlying container is `std::array<CharT, N>` and it uses the famous trick â€” made popular by [fbstring](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/FBString.md) â€” of storing the remaining size within the last byte of the string.

```cpp
using Name = inplace_string<15>;
// 16 bytes on stack, size included
Name name = "foo";
auto it = name.find("r");
assert(it == Name::npos);
name += "bar";
std::string str(name); // implicit string_view construction
```

## Meta Stuff

* [GitHub](https://github.com/eliasdaler/MetaStuff) (MIT)
* [Article](https://eliasdaler.github.io/meta-stuff/)

> This is the code I use in my game for all serialization/deserialization/introspection stuff.

* Strongly typed and doesn't use RTTI or virtual functions in any way.
* No dependencies. You have to use modern C++ compiler which supports C++14, though. (VS 2015, GCC 5+, Clang 3.8)
* Serialization is not limited to a particular format.

## Ultra-fast Serialization of C++ Objects

[Article](http://ithare.com/ultra-fast-serialization-of-c-objects/)

Goal: The fastest possible serialization for in-memory structure, assuming that it will be deserialized by **exactly the same executable**.

## Use for the Poop emoji

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/75gohf/i_just_found_a_use_for_the_poop_emoji_in_c/)

This detects whether the Visual Studio project has the proper UTF-8 flags set to compile it correctly.

```cpp
static_assert(
    (static_cast<unsigned char>("ðŸ’©"[0]) == 0xF0) &&
    (static_cast<unsigned char>("ðŸ’©"[1]) == 0x9F) &&
    (static_cast<unsigned char>("ðŸ’©"[2]) == 0x92) &&
    (static_cast<unsigned char>("ðŸ’©"[3]) == 0xA9),
        "Source or compiler not UTF-8 compliant!"
        " Add flag /utf-8 for Visual Studio");
```

## Quotes

Dennis Kubes:

> C is memory with syntactic sugar.

Steve Haflich:

> When your hammer is C++, everything begins to look like a thumb.
