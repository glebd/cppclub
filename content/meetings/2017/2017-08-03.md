# Meeting 3 August 2017

## Toronto trip report by Andrew Pardoe (MSFT)

[Post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/07/28/trip-report-evolution-working-group-at-the-summer-iso-c-standards-meeting-toronto/)

* Biggest news: [Concepts TS](https://wg21.link/p0734) merged into [C++ draft standard](https://wg21.link/n4659)
    * EWG is committed to bringing back an abbreviated syntax in future meetings, ideally before C++20 is finished. [P0694R0](https://wg21.link/P0694) is a paper by Bjarne Stroustrup on the natural syntax.
* [Modules TS](https://wg21.link/n4610) discussions in detail
* Other proposals described in detail
* Discouraged proposals

* Detailed report on Concepts TS

> AFTs have been controversial since their introduction, due to their ability to make template code look like non-template code. Many have argued that this is a bad idea, beacuse template code is fundamentally different from non-template code (e.g. consider different name lookup rules, the need for syntactic disambiguators like typename, and the ability to define a function out of line). Others have argued that making generic programming (programming with templates) look more like regular programming is a good thing.

> I really don't understand this desire for a syntactic marker. IDEs are perfectly capable of semantic highlighting [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6r54xc/trip_report_c_standards_meeting_in_toronto_july/dl2r838/)

> I don't think it's really so important to recognize templates that they need to be called out that way at all [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6r54xc/trip_report_c_standards_meeting_in_toronto_july/dl3ntiu/)

> more than 30 years ago, when overloading was introduced in C++ there was a requirement of an overload declaration with the overload keyword. It didn't work out [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6r54xc/trip_report_c_standards_meeting_in_toronto_july/dl3ntiu/)

> I actually can't remember if I have ever wanted to know whether a function is a template or not <...> You should not program in 2017 using 20 year old tools, nor should a language feature implemented in 2017 be designed with 20 year old tools in mind.

> <...> not everyone uses editors with semantic highlighting capabilities, and that people often look at code in non-editor contexts like code review tools
>> The language should not accumulate cruft to accommodate 10 year old tools [#](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6r54xc/trip_report_c_standards_meeting_in_toronto_july/dl3hfo1/)

## [What should the C++ Standards Committee be doing?](https://isocpp.org/blog/2017/07/what-should-the-iso-cpp-standards-committee-be-doing)

1. Compile-time stability: Every change in behavior in a new version of the standard is detectable by a compiler for the previous version.
2. Link-time stability: ABI breakage is avoided except in very rare cases, which will be welldocumented and supported by a written rationale.
3. Compiler performance stability: Changes will not imply significant added compile-time costs for existing code.
4. Run-time Performance stability: Changes will not imply added run-time costs to existing code.
5. Progress: Every revision of the standard will offer improved support for some significant programming activity or community.
6. Simplicity: Every revision of the standard will offer some simplification of some significant programming activity.
7. Timeliness: The next revision of the standard will be shipped on time according to a published schedule.

## Precompiled header issues and recommendations

[Andrew Pardoe et al., Microsoft](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/07/13/precompiled-header-pch-issues-and-recommendations/)

* Move to a newer compiler, use x64 compiler
* Multi-CPU systems: Failure to automatically increase the pagefile size (Windows bug)
* Pass `/p:PreferredToolArchtecture=x64` to MSBuild
* Use `/MP` compiler option ([Details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/mp-build-with-multiple-processes))
* Don't use `#pragma hdrstop`, use `/Fp<PCH-file-name>` instead

## Undocumented MSVC options for build timing

* Compiler: `/Bt+`
* Linker: `/time+`

## Using Trompeloeil (Björn Fahller)

A mocking framework for modern C++ (C++14, single header)

## cppcoro: a library of coroutine abstractions

> The 'cppcoro' library provides a set of general-purpose primitives for making use of the coroutines TS proposal described in N4628.

[GitHub](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro)

* Coroutine types: `task<T>`, `lazy_task<T>`, `shared_task<T>`, `shared_lazy_task<T>`, `generator<T>`, `recursive_generator<T>`, `async_generator<T>`
* Awaitable types: `single_consumer_event`, `async_mutex`, `async_manual_reset_event`, `async_auto_reset_event`
* Cancellation: `cancellation_token`, `cancellation_source`, `cancellation_registration`
* Schedulers and I/O: `io_service`, `io_work_scope`, `file`, `readable_file`, `writable_file`, `read_only_file`, `write_only_file`, `read_write_file`
