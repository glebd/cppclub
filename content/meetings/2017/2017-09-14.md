# Meeting 14 September 2017

## Boost 1.65.1 released

[Release notes](http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_65_1.html)

## LLVM 5 released

* [Announcement](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-announce/2017-September/000075.html)

* (Why the big jump from 4.0.1? With the new versioning scheme, the major version is incremented for each major release:
[http://blog.llvm.org/2016/12/llvms-new-versioning-scheme.html](http://blog.llvm.org/2016/12/llvms-new-versioning-scheme.html))
* [Release notes](http://releases.llvm.org/5.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html)

## Clang 5 released

* [Release notes](http://releases.llvm.org/5.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html)
* Support for the C++17 standard has been completed.
* C++ coroutines TS implemented
* [New UBSan diagnostics](http://releases.llvm.org/5.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#undefined-behavior-sanitizer-ubsan)

## Two-phase name lookup support comes to MSVC

[Blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/09/11/two-phase-name-lookup-support-comes-to-msvc/)

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

void func(void*) { std::puts("void*"); }

template<typename T>
void g(T x) { func(0); }

void func(int) { std::puts("int"); }

int main()
{
    g(3.14);
}
```

## C++Now 2017: Kris Jusiak â€œTowards Painless Testing"

{{<youtube id="NVrZjT5lW5o" title="C++Now 2017: Kris Jusiak \"Towards Painless Testing\"">}}

## Hell is a multi-threaded C++ program

[Mark Bessey](http://codemines.blogspot.co.uk/2006/09/hell-is-multi-threaded-c-program.html)

* POSIX Threads, Mach Threads, Windows Threads, Java Threads, and C# Threads all work very much the same.
* The POSIX threading model is just about the simplest possible implementation of multi-threading you could have: all of your threads share the same address space.
* With Pthreads, _it's too easy to make something that almost works_.
* The other major model for multi-threading is known as message-passing multiprocessing: your threads don't share any state by default.
* Two popular variants of the message-passing model are "[Communicating Sequential Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)" and the "[Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)".

## Another thread on ... threads

[Mark Bessey](http://codemines.blogspot.co.uk/2006/09/another-thread-on-threads.html)

* Do consider whether you need to use threads at all
* Don't use threads to avoid blocking on I/O
* Do know what each thread in your program is for
  - Don't spawn threads in response to external events
* Don't reinvent the wheel
  - Do stay on the well-trodden path
* Do consider developing a strategy for detecting and/or avoiding deadlocks
* Do consider a message-passing design
* Don't hold a lock or semaphore any longer than actually necessary
* Do use multiple threads to get better performance on multi-processor systems

## CppCast: Volta and CUDA C++

[Podcast](http://cppcast.com/2017/09/olivier-giroux/)

Olivier Giroux has worked on eight GPU and four SM architecture generations released by NVIDIA. Lately, he works to clarify the forms and semantics of valid GPU programs, present and future. He was the programming model lead for the new NVIDIA Volta architecture. He is a member of WG21, the ISO C++ committee, and is a passionate contributor to C++'s forward progress guarantees and memory model.

## See-phit: A template engine that uses compile-time HTML parsing

* [GitHub](https://github.com/rep-movsd/see-phit)
* C++14 (uses `constexpr` functions)
* Fails to compile if HTML is malformed
* The maximum number of nodes and attributes per parse is hardcoded to 1024
* LGPL 3.0 (how does that even work with a compile-time library?)

* Content-to-noise ratio of the code
* Refactoring-safe code formatting
* Naming things
* Word cloud for your code

## Zach Laine: Pragmatic Type Erasure

{{<youtube id="0I0FD3N5cgM" title="Zach Laine: Pragmatic Type Erasure">}}

```cpp
struct anything {
  template<typename T> anything(T t);
  template<typename T> anything& operator =(T t);
  int value() const {return handle_->value();}

  struct handle_base {
    virtual ~handle_base() {}
    virtual handle_base* clone() const = 0;
    virtual int value() const = 0;
  }

  template<typename T>
  struct handle: public handle_base {
    handle(T value);
    virtual handle_base* clone() const;
    virtual int value() const {return value.value();}
    T value;
  }

  std::unique_ptr<handle_base> handle_;
}
```

### Pros

* Value semantics
* Never writing `new` or `delete`
* Ability to bind types to interfaces never seen before, including multiple interfaces
* Thread safety via CoW
* Elision of heap allocations for small types and references

### Cons

* Complex implementation
* Thread safety comes at a cost of atomic operations and copies when values are mutated

### Tools and libraries

* [Boost.TypeErasure](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/doc/html/boost_typeerasure.html)
* [Emtypen](https://github.com/tzlaine/type_erasure/tree/master/emtypen): takes a C++ header with one or more interfaces and produces a type-erased version (Clang-based)

## Cheinan Marks: Practical Type Erasure

{{<youtube id="5PZVuUzP34g" title="Cheinan Marks: Practical Type Erasure">}}

* Type erasure is the glue between generic (front end) and OO (back end) code
* Used in `std::shared_ptr`, `std::function`
* Type-safe configuration system using `boost::any`
* [Type erasure article by Thomas Becker, Artima](http://www.artima.com/cppsource/type_erasure.html)

## CppCon 2014: Jens Weller "0xBADC0DE"

{{<youtube id="JE2WO0G3nCQ" title="CppCon 2014: Jens Weller \"0xBADC0DE\"">}}

* Antipatterns
* Bad working environments
* Non-developer managers
* Absence of tests

## Pyry Jahkola - Inheritance free polymorphism - Meeting C++ 2012

{{<youtube id="y54sKDKrDX8" title="Pyry Jahkola - Inheritance free polymorphism - Meeting C++ 2012">}}

* Type erasure
* Code examples

### Rant

* A great presentation ruined by terrible sound, editing and postprocessing.
* Laptop mic &rArr; tinny inaudible sound
* Editor's "comments"
* Lack of sync between the video and the slides
* 15 FPS postal stamp-size video
* Futile attempts by the editor to move the video window around to avoid obscuring the slides
* Non-working mouse (with audible clicks, no less)
