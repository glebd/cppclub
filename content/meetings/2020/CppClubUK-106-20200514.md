# Meeting 106 (14 May 2020)

## 2020-04 WG21 mailing is out

* [Mailing](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/#mailing2020-04)
  * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g75uab/202004_wg21_mailing_is_out/)
  * [P1654R1 ABI breakage - summary of initial comments](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1654r1.html)
  * [P1949R3 C++ Identifier Syntax using Unicode Standard Annex 31](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1949r3.html)
  * [P2011R1 A pipeline-rewrite operator](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2011r1.html)
    * This paper proposes a new non-overloadable operator `|>` such that the expression `x |> f(y)`  evaluates exactly as `f(x, y)`. There would be no intermediate subexpression `f(y)`.

## How to Pass Class Member Functions to STL Algorithms

* [Article by Jonathan Boccara](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2020/03/06/how-to-pass-class-member-functions-to-stl-algorithms/)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/febn53/fluent_c_how_to_pass_class_member_functions_to/)

[STL writes](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/febn53/fluent_c_how_to_pass_class_member_functions_to/fjn009x?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x):

> `mem_fn` is less typing, but lambdas are higher performance (MSVC’s optimizer can’t see through `mem_fn`’s data member) and can handle overloaded/templated member functions much more easily.

## Parameter passing, by Raymond Chen, Microsoft

* [If you plan on keeping the parameter anyway, then there’s no need to have separate `T const&` and `T&&` overloads](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200219-00/?p=103452)
* [If you’re not keeping the parameter, then you still want to have separate `T const&` and `T&&` overloads](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200220-00/?p=103463)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/f73g4a/if_youre_not_keeping_the_parameter_then_you_still/)

## GSL 3.0.0 Release

The Guidelines Support Library (GSL) contains functions and types that are suggested for use by the C++ Core Guidelines maintained by the Standard C++ Foundation.

* [Microsoft](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/gsl-3-0-0-release/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

Changes:

* New implementations of `gsl::span` and `gsl::span_iterator` that align to the C++20 standard.
* Changes to contract violation behavior.
* Additional CMake support.
* Deprecation of `gsl::multi_span` and `gsl::strided_span`.

## DeepCode adds AI-based static code analysis support for C and C++

* [Announcement](https://medium.com/deepcode-ai/deepcode-adds-ai-based-static-code-analysis-support-for-c-and-c-83128ecee90f)

## Modern CMake is like inheritance

* [Kuba Sejdak](https://kubasejdak.com/modern-cmake-is-like-inheritance)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/erbkrk/modern_cmake_is_like_inheritance/)

> If only the CMake website featured such a beginner-friendly description as found here, people would switch over to Modern CMake much faster.
