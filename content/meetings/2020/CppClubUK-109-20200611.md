# Meeting 109 (11 June 2020)

## C++ is now the only language to appear in three HOPLs in a row

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h0gxo5/c_is_now_the_only_language_to_appear_in_three/)

### Papers

* [HOPL-II, 1993 A History of C++: 1979-1991](http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf)
* [HOPL-III, 2007 Evolving a language in and for the real world: C++ 1991-2006](http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf)
* [HOPL-IV, 2020 Thriving in a crowded and changing world: C++ 2006-2020](https://www.stroustrup.com/hopl20main-p5-p-bfc9cd4--final.pdf)

## C++: The Next Seismic Shift

* [Dale Mellor](https://rdmp.org/dmbcs/seismic-c++)
  * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gle6y0/c_the_next_seismic_shift/)

> The next seismic shift for C++ would be the provision of a mechanism for the user to present
> compile-time code, as ‘beige’ C++: code which programmatically re-writes the final code which gets
> compiled to object and then to machine code.

* [GNU Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html)

## What kinds of C++ jobs are available apart from game development?

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gn0ffp/forgive_my_ignorance_but_what_kind_of_jobs_can/)
* [What are you writing in C++ at work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/e6sigs/what_are_you_writing_in_c_at_work/)

## How to ask for C++ coding help

* [Kate Gregory](http://www.gregcons.com/KateBlog/HowToAskForCCodingHelp.aspx)
  * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gvw8y3/how_to_ask_for_c_coding_help_kate_gregory/)
  * [#include Discord](https://www.includecpp.org/)
  * [Cpplang Slack](https://cpplang-inviter.cppalliance.org/)

> <...> if you want free mentoring and consulting from successful people, you can have it! All you
> need to do is ask. But if you expect your helpers to do most of the work in helping you, and to
> take instruction and direction from you, you’re going to get a lot less help than if you know how
> to be helped effectively.

## C-Reduce

C-Reduce is a tool that takes a large C, C++, or OpenCL file that has a property of interest (such
as triggering a compiler bug) and automatically produces a much smaller C/C++ file that has the same
property. It is intended for use by people who discover and report bugs in compilers and other tools
that process source code.
