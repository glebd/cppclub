# Meeting 5 December 2019

## How can you be so certain?

> We are defining a language for decades of use. A bit of humility is necessary.

## When is it justified to use C++ for a project?

## Is it time for a rebased Boost2 that assumes C++20 as its starting point?

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/dvt6lw/is_it_time_for_a_rebased_boost2_that_assumes_c20/)

**TL;DR:** No.

## Eliminating the Static Overhead of Ranges

[Colby Pike](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2019/10/21/rngs-static-ovr.html) --- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/dkxcwd/eliminating_the_static_overhead_of_ranges/)

### Without ranges

```cpp
vector<string> child_names;
for (auto& person : all_people) {
    if (person.age < 14) {
        child_names.push_back(person.name);
    }
}
```

### With ranges

```cpp
auto children_names =
    all_people
    | filter([](const auto& person) { return person.age < 14; })
    | transform([](const auto& person) { return person.name; })
    | to_vector;
```

## The arrow operator

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10678920/10154):

> The `operator->` has special semantics in the language in that, when overloaded, it reapplies itself to the result. While the rest of the operators are applied only once, `operator->` will be applied by the compiler as many times as needed to get to a raw pointer and once more to access the memory referred by that pointer.

```cpp
struct A { void foo(); };
struct B { A* operator->(); };
struct C { B operator->(); };
struct D { C operator->(); };
int main() {
    D d;
    d->foo();
}
```

Thanks to Martin Waplington for suggesting this.
