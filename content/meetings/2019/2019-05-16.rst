Blue Oak License
----------------

https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0

    Blue Oak Council’s model license demonstrates all the techniques that licenses can use to make software free and
    simple for everyone to use and build on, in everyday language that everyone can understand.

https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/03/09/Deprecation-Notice.html

    MIT and BSD open source licenses are well known, popular, and legally deprecated. They served long and well, but
    they’re older than many open source software developers, and haven’t been maintained.
