## "Making new friends" idiom by Dan Saks

[Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Making_New_Friends)

> The goal is to simplify creation of friend functions for a class template.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T& t) { value = t; }
   friend ostream& operator <<(ostream& os, const Foo<T>& b)
   {
      return os << b.value;
   }
};
```
