# Twitter: Remove one C++ feature?

**Jason Turner** (@lefticus‬) [29/01/2018, 18:24](https://twitter.com/lefticus/status/958043266510856192): You can remove exactly one feature from C++. Which one and why?

**Ólafur Waage** (‪@olafurw‬): The damned int/char fallback for types. I want to not compare apples with oranges. The ability to skip {} on 1 line if/while/etc, so bug prone on large projects. For std, redo the entire getline or read from input system, it's a huge hurdle for new programmers.

**Simon Brand** (‪@TartanLlama‬): iostreams. Replace with something less noisy and more performant.

**Matt Calabrese** (‪@CppSage‬): ADL. How to properly call a function is so subtle, especially in a template, that basically no one does it correctly.

**Björn Fahller** (‪@bjorn_fahller‬): Lossy implicit conversions

# Twitter: Remove one C++ feature? (cont.)

**Victor Ciura** (‪@ciura_victor‬): ‪`const` should be the *default* (no keyword) for all types (built-in and user defined) and you should opt in for mutability with a storage qualifier like `mutable`. And as long as we’re on the subject, why not `constexpr` by *default* for all expressions?

**Patricia Aas** (‪@pati_gallardo‬): ‪Don't know if it's considered a feature but : signed integer overflow being Undefined Behavior, couldn't we just wrap? This is a trap waiting for a beginner imo

* Jason Turner (‪@lefticus‬): I just saw a comment on this, but cannot find it now. Seems the problem is that 1's complement, 2's complement or sign bit is not specified in the standard, so no way to specify signed overflow, without requiring a specific representation first.

# Twitter: Remove one C++ feature? (cont.)

**Unreal_Skif** (‪@Unreal_Skif‬): C preprocessor

**Jan Wilmans** (‪@janwilmans‬): what i'd really like is to be able to subset the language by `--disable-feature=Xxx` so I can opt-out on all the old stuff for new development

**Joseph Hurtado** (‪@josephhurtado‬): Multiple inheritance.

**Nicholas Gildea** (‪@ngildea85‬): Backwards compatibility with previous versions. Clean break to tidy up & streamline existing features (e.g. make features part of the language not standard lib). If that's not cheating ;)

**Corentin** (‪@Cor3ntin‬): can I say Macros?

# Twitter: Remove one C++ feature? (cont.)

@science_dot‬: Everything that is only there to make C89 code valid C++ code. C++ isn’t a superset of C anymore and everything that results from programmers thinking this way is bad.

**John Schroedl** (‪@fourbadcats‬): `unsigned size_t`. Avoid all those casts to shut the compiler up. Signed/unsigned bugs

**Oliver Seiler** (‪@oseiler‬): C-style casts. I really want people to have to type a lot to abuse the type system.

**Michał Dominiak** (‪@Guriwesu‬): C.

# Reddit: Which C++ features should be considered legacy?

[Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/74t184/question_which_c_featureslibrariespatterns_should/)

* `rand()` and `srand()` -- use `<random>`
* Raw owning pointers
* `std::bind` -- use lambdas
* `typedef` -- use `using`
* RTTI
* "The entire C library, C-style arrays and casts, non-RAII resource management, digraphs, goto, new, delete. Personally I'd add octal numbers as well, but maybe that's just me."
* `auto_ptr`
* `vector<bool>`

# Twitter: One thing about C++

**Jason Turner** (@lefticus):
You have the opportunity to tell someone 1 thing about C++. What would it be? What's the most important thing you'd want to communicate?

**Ciro Duran** (@chiguire):
You know the exact moment that an object is destroyed

Matt Bentley @xolvenz
@lefticus Here is the rabbit hole. Somewhere, near the bottom, is performance. There are many stones in the way. Don't let them stop you. Start digging.

Jan Wilmans @janwilmans
@lefticus C++ is not as hard is it is made out to be. Also it is getting easier over time.

Octavio Cruz @OctavioCruz
@lefticus Embrace RAII

Laurie Hedge @lauriehedge
@lefticus C++ isn't an OO language, or a low level language. It's a multi-paradigm language, meaning it gives you the tools you need for the job in hand. If something seems hard, explore the language and see if you can't use another tool it provides.

pmf @pmf
@lefticus Run if you can.

enrabiar @enrabiar
@lefticus C++ programming can be anything but boring

Alex Khanin @twiz718
@lefticus auto and lambdas

Billy O'Neal @MalwareMinigun
@lefticus Destructors.

Nikos Chantziaras @realnc
@lefticus You get paid more.

Peter Blackburn @Peter_Blackburn
@lefticus You will never know everything about it unlike other languages!

Kate Gregory @gregcons
@lefticus That it is not what you remember it to be

Silva Puth @silva_puth
@lefticus C++ is one defacto package manager away from being widely adopted by modern, open source developers.

Michael May @mcmay2010
@lefticus Don't start learning it. Or, once you start, don't stop.

Florian ☕ @badbadc0ffee
@lefticus Don't try to manually optimize your code. Try to write well understandable code that you and your peers can easily read and comprehend, your compiler will optimize better than you ever could - most of the times. Check out http://godbolt.org if you don't think so.

Nicolai Josuttis @NicoJosuttis
@lefticus C++ is a very helpful nightmare

Tony Van Eerd @tvaneerd
@lefticus The type system can greatly increase your odds of writing correct code.

Victor Ordu @BroVic
@lefticus (Modern) C++ is several languages rolled up in one. Make your pick per time.

Adi Shavit @AdiShavit
@lefticus Strongly typed compile-time superpowers.

Dominik Haska @DominikHaska
@lefticus Moore has ended. C++ is back.
