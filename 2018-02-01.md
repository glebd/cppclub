# Twitter: Remove one C++ feature?

**Jason Turner** (@lefticus‬) [29/01/2018, 18:24](https://twitter.com/lefticus/status/958043266510856192): You can remove exactly one feature from C++. Which one and why?

**Ólafur Waage** (‪@olafurw‬): The damned int/char fallback for types. I want to not compare apples with oranges. The ability to skip {} on 1 line if/while/etc, so bug prone on large projects. For std, redo the entire getline or read from input system, it's a huge hurdle for new programmers.

**Simon Brand** (‪@TartanLlama‬): iostreams. Replace with something less noisy and more performant.

**Matt Calabrese** (‪@CppSage‬): ADL. How to properly call a function is so subtle, especially in a template, that basically no one does it correctly.

**Björn Fahller** (‪@bjorn_fahller‬): Lossy implicit conversions

# Twitter: Remove one C++ feature? (cont.)

**Victor Ciura** (‪@ciura_victor‬): ‪`const` should be the *default* (no keyword) for all types (built-in and user defined) and you should opt in for mutability with a storage qualifier like `mutable`. And as long as we’re on the subject, why not `constexpr` by *default* for all expressions?

**Patricia Aas** (‪@pati_gallardo‬): ‪Don't know if it's considered a feature but : signed integer overflow being Undefined Behavior, couldn't we just wrap? This is a trap waiting for a beginner imo

* Jason Turner (‪@lefticus‬): I just saw a comment on this, but cannot find it now. Seems the problem is that 1's complement, 2's complement or sign bit is not specified in the standard, so no way to specify signed overflow, without requiring a specific representation first.

**Unreal_Skif** (‪@Unreal_Skif‬): C preprocessor

**Jan Wilmans** (‪@janwilmans‬): what i'd really like is to be able to subset the language by `--disable-feature=Xxx` so I can opt-out on all the old stuff for new development

**Joseph Hurtado** (‪@josephhurtado‬): Multiple inheritance.

**Nicholas Gildea** (‪@ngildea85‬): Backwards compatibility with previous versions. Clean break to tidy up & streamline existing features (e.g. make features part of the language not standard lib). If that's not cheating ;)

**Corentin** (‪@Cor3ntin‬): can I say Macros?

# Twitter: Remove one C++ feature? (cont.)

@science_dot‬: Everything that is only there to make C89 code valid C++ code. C++ isn’t a superset of C anymore and everything that results from programmers thinking this way is bad.

**John Schroedl** (‪@fourbadcats‬): `unsigned size_t`. Avoid all those casts to shut the compiler up. Signed/unsigned bugs

**Oliver Seiler** (‪@oseiler‬): C-style casts. I really want people to have to type a lot to abuse the type system.

**Michał Dominiak** (‪@Guriwesu‬): C.
