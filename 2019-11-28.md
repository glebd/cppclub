# Eliminating the Static Overhead of Ranges

[Colby Pike](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2019/10/21/rngs-static-ovr.html) --- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/dkxcwd/eliminating_the_static_overhead_of_ranges/)

## Without ranges

```cpp
vector<string> child_names;
for (auto& person : all_people) {
    if (person.age < 14) {
        child_names.push_back(person.name);
    }
}
```

## With ranges

```cpp
auto children_names =
    all_people
    | filter([](const auto& person) { return person.age < 14; })
    | transform([](const auto& person) { return person.name; })
    | to_vector;
```

# The arrow operator (1/2)

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10678920/10154):

> The `operator->` has special semantics in the language in that, when overloaded, it reapplies itself to the result. While the rest of the operators are applied only once, `operator->` will be applied by the compiler as many times as needed to get to a raw pointer and once more to access the memory referred by that pointer.

# The arrow operator (2/2)

```cpp
struct A { void foo(); };
struct B { A* operator->(); };
struct C { B operator->(); };
struct D { C operator->(); };
int main() {
    D d;
    d->foo();
}
```

Thanks to Martin Waplington for suggesting this.

> The value of a paper like this would be to narrow the scope or domain of a problem to something that would be useful component in solving bigger problems. This paper does the opposite - expanding the domain to encompass the whole world of physics.

# C++ `std::string_view` for better performance: An example use case

[Arthur O'Dwyer: `std::string_view` is a borrow type](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2018/03/27/string-view-is-a-borrow-type/)

> Borrow types are essentially “borrowed” references to existing objects. They lack ownership; they are short-lived; they generally can do without an assignment operator. They generally appear only in function parameter lists; because they lack ownership semantics, they generally cannot be stored in data structures or returned safely from functions.
