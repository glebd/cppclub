## Prague Trip Reports

* [Bryce Lelbach et al.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/f47x4o/202002_prague_iso_c_committee_trip_report_c20_is/)
  * 252 attendees! 23 subgroups! 9 tracks!
  * **C++20** is done!
  * **C++23** roadmap! **Standard library modules**; **library support for coroutines**; **executors**; **networking**. Also: reflection; pattern matching; contracts.
* [Herb Sutter](https://herbsutter.com/2020/02/15/trip-report-winter-iso-c-standards-meeting-prague/)

## C++20 is here

## Bjarne Stroustrup on C++20's significance

* [ISO C++](https://isocpp.org//blog/2020/02/bjarne-stroustrup-on-cpp20s-significance)
  * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/f7h6xn/bjarne_stroustrup_on_c20s_significance/)

Quote:

* 30 years of C++ standardization.
* 40 years of C++.
* C++20 is the 6th standard, the 3rd major standard; by “major” I mean “changes the way people think.”
* This is something like the 75th meeting; I have been at about 70 of those.

## Excited about C++20

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/f62nyr/are_you_excited_about_c_20/)

[Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/f62nyr/are_you_excited_about_c_20/fi2vjbg/):

> I work in a large codebase that was originally written in C and was compiled with C++03 just a few years ago. Since then, we have upgraded through C++11, C++14 and are now using C++17.
> So far, my experience is that every upgrade has been almost exclusively a positive experience, and each version has made it easier to write safe and expressive code.

## Concepts pushed to Clang master

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/eqrv1n/gcc_c_coroutines_initial_implementation_pushed_to/)

> This is not enabled by default (even for **-std=c++2a**), it needs **-fcoroutines**

## How to keep up with C++ news

  * join the commitee!
  * don't...

## CppCast Ep. 233: Large Scale C++ with John Lakos

* [Audio](https://cppcast.com/john-lakos-large-scale-cpp/)
* [Video](https://youtu.be/cP_kjF63WAY)

> There's a misunderstanding (of contracts in the C++ committee -- GD) that's not easy to appreciate if you're not a real day-to-day software engineer. That is what derailed contracts. I will fix it. I promise you, I will fix it.

## Follow-up: Aggregates

From [CppReference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization): An aggregate is one of the following types:

* array type
* class type (typically, `struct` or `union`), that has
  * no private or protected *direct* (since C++17) non-static data members
  * no *user-declared constructors* (until C++11)
  * no *user-provided constructors* (explicitly defaulted or deleted constructors are allowed) (since C++11) (until C++17)
  * no *user-provided, inherited, or explicit constructors* (explicitly defaulted or deleted constructors are allowed) (since C++17) (until C++20)
  * no *user-declared or inherited constructors* (since C++20)
  * no virtual, private, or *protected* (since C++17) base classes
  * no virtual member functions
  * no *default member initializers* (since C++11) (until C++14)

## Structured Exceptions (Win32) and C++

* [Raymond Chen: How can I handle both structured exceptions and C++ exceptions potentially coming from the same source?](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200116-00/?p=103333)

## "Making new friends" idiom by Dan Saks

[Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Making_New_Friends)

> The goal is to simplify creation of friend functions for a class template.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T& t) { value = t; }
   friend ostream& operator <<(ostream& os, const Foo<T>& b)
   {
      return os << b.value;
   }
};
```

## A new decade, a new tool: **libman**

* [Colby Pike (vector-of-bool)](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2020/01/06/new-decade.html)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ekwb4y/a_new_decade_a_new_tool/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/libman)
* [Specification](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/?force=1&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vector-of-bool/libman/develop/data/spec.bs)

**libman** is a new level of indirection between package management and build systems.

**dds** is Drop-Dead Simple build and package manager.

## Move, simply

* [Herb Sutter](https://herbsutter.com/2020/02/17/move-simply/)
  * [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22349302)

> The state of `a` after it has been moved from is the same as the state of `a` after any other non-const operation. Move is just another non-constfunction that might (or might not) change the value of the source object.

* [*Move, even more simply* by Corentin Jabot](https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/move/)

> In the absence of other information, do not do anything to an object on which `std::move` has been called, except assignment operator and destructor.

## Rust is better than C++20, by David Sankel

David Sankel, "We Have C++20" bloopers:

> (C++) is like Rust, but worse.

Operator:

> What's better about Rust?

David Sankel:
