# Conan, vcpkg or build2?

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9m4l0p/conan_vcpkg_or_build2/)

* Pragmatic choice: vcpkg or Conan (they work today and are complete enough)
* Pragmatic no-brainer choice: vcpkg (it's the simplest and it have more packages ready)
* Pragmatic but need finer control choice: Conan (it gives more options)
* (Very) Long term choice: Build2 (shows great promises because it uses a coherent model...)
* Ideal choice (from the future): help SG15 (the group reflecting on tools vs C++) define interfaces for build systems and dependency managers so that your choice is not impacted by your dependencies choices.
