# Feedback on the distributed C++ meetup

* [Post by Jean Guegant](http://jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/distributed-c++-meetup-0x02.html)
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31mQmUryw50)
* Lessons:
    * Two-city format is best, 3-city is too much
    * Need breaks
    * 15-min talks are ideal
    * Slides need a bigger font
    * Mandatory NDA is bad
    * Turn the lights on in the audience

# Brigand -- Instant compile time C++ 11 metaprogramming library (cont.)

* Example tasks:
    * Create a tuple from a list of types and then transform it into a variant
    * Look for the presence of a type in a tuple and get its index
    * Sort a list of types
    * Advanced static assertion with arithmetics and complex functions
    * Go through a list of types and perform a runtime action for each type
