# C++London: The Badlands of C++ (game development)


## Valentin Galea

- MSVC is prevalent
- Huge amounts of legacy code using C++98
- Mostly proprietary code, sometimes really ugly
- Process- and deadline-driven, no clean-up exercises ("ship it!")
- Warnings are just fine (ignored)
- Low-latency specifics
    + no exceptions
    + minimize allocations
    + special container versions (EASTL)
- garbage collection for dynamic objects (Lua)
