# Prof. Liskov receives 2018 Computer Pioneer Award

[Web](https://www.computer.org/web/pressroom/liskov-2018-computer-pioneer-award)

Prof. Barbara Liskov Selected to Receive the 2018 IEEE Computer Society’s Computer Pioneer Award. The award is given for significant contributions to early concepts and developments in the electronic computer field, which have clearly advanced the state-of-the-art in computing. Liskov is being recognized “for pioneering data abstraction, polymorphism, and support for fault tolerance and distributed computing in the programming languages CLU and Argus."

# P0581R1: Standard Library Modules

[P0581R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0581r1.pdf)

* Leave “C headers” alone
* Present modules as logical sets of functionalities
* Robust support for C++ in diverse environments
* Every standard facility is provided by exactly one module

As a first approximation, we suggest the following:

* `std.fundamental`
* `std.core`
* `std.math`
* `std.io`
* `std.concurrency`
* `std.os`
* `std`

# P0942R0: Introducing a `<smart_ptr>` header

[P0942R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0942r0.html)

# P0122R6: `span`: bounds-safe views for sequences of objects

* [P0122R6](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0122r6.pdf)
* [P0546r2 : Span - foundation for the future](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0546r2.html)

The `span` type is an abstraction that provides a view over a contiguous sequence of objects, the storage of which is  owned by some other object.

Requires C++11. A reference implementation is available as part of [Microsoft GSL](https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL).

# P0201R3: `polymorphic_value`: a polymorphic value-type for C++

[P0201R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0201r3.pdf)

Add a class template, `polymorphic_value<T>`, to the standard library to support polymorphic objects with value-like semantics. Copies are deep and `const` is propagated to the owned object.

# p0907r0: Signed Integers are Two’s Complement

* [p0907r0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0907r0.html)

# P0645R1: Text Formatting

[P0645R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0645r1.html)

This paper proposes a new text formatting library that can be used as a safe and extensible alternative to the `printf` family of functions. It is intended to complement the existing C++ I/O streams library and reuse some of its infrastructure such as overloaded insertion operators for user-defined types.

Example:

```cpp
string message = fmt::format("The answer is {}.", 42);
```

A full implementation of this proposal is available at [https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt).

# P0671R1: Parametric functions

Please don't assume that you know what this paper is about. Several people have invested time e.g. for discussions of the feature, making it reasonable, and making it new (i.e. I am aware of past discussions). This is different and I appreciate that you make up your mind based on what's written here. I am almost certain: you haven't seen this before.

* [P0671R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0671r1.html)

Allow naming arguments in regular index-based, C++-style function calls, but ignoring them from the standard's point of view (but not necessarily so from the implementers')

```cpp
double Gauss(double x, double mean = 0.,
             double width = 1., double height = 1.);
Gauss(0.1, mean := 0., width := 2.); // same as below
Gauss(0.1, 0., 2.);
```

# Blaze C++14 maths library

* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/blaze-lib/blaze) (BSD)

Blaze is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library for dense and sparse arithmetic. With its state-of-the-art Smart Expression Template implementation Blaze combines the elegance and ease of use of a domain-specific language with HPC-grade performance, making it one of the most intuitive and fastest C++ math libraries available.
