* Explicit outlining
* Hidden friends
* Link less
* Extern template
* **Modules** (_not mentioned..._ -- _GD_)

* [Answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j3fjh8/stdlistsort_vs_stdsort/g7bvx7d/)

Scott Meyers, [Effective STL](https://www.aristeia.com/books.html):

> Item 44: Prefer member functions to algorithms with the same name.

## The Defold game engine code style

[Article](https://defold.com/2020/05/31/The-Defold-engine-code-style/)

### Code style

* C-like C++
* No classes (_huh?_ -- _GD_)
* No exceptions
* No STL
  * Custom containers
* Data ownership tracking
* C++98

(_It's the end of 2020, by the way. -- GD_)

## Should I use C++ exceptions?

## C++17 Zero allocation Coroutine/[Resumable function] library

[GitHub](https://github.com/seppeon/SCoro)

This does not use C++20 coroutines. It is a managed state machine style coroutine library, a modern take on [Duff's device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device).

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ikhlvw/c17_zero_allocation_coroutineresumable_function/)

> I do not buy any of these anti-coroutine arguments (maybe except for the fact that HALO can fail in some situations -- but that is an engineering problem in the compiler).

Later, same author on Reddit: [C++20 coroutines, opinions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j1xhgv/c20_coroutines_opinions/) And yes, [Rust gets mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j1xhgv/c20_coroutines_opinions/g72puhx/).

## 6 Efficient Things You Can Do to Refactor a C++ Project

[B. Filipek](https://www.bfilipek.com/2020/08/6things-refactor.html)

1. Update the Compiler and Set Correct C++ Standard Conformance
2. Fix Code With Deprecated or Removed C++ Features
3. Start Adding Unit Tests
4. Decouple or Extract Classes
5. Extract Non-member Functions
6. Reduce the Global State

## Library: cpp-lazy

[GitHub](https://github.com/MarcDirven/cpp-lazy)

Cpp-lazy is a fast and easy lazy evaluation library for C++14/17/20.

Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy which holds the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed. In this library, all the iterators are lazy evaluated.

This library is not a replacement for `ranges::v3` but rather a (smaller) alternative.
