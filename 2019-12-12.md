> The value of a paper like this would be to narrow the scope or domain of a problem to something that would be useful component in solving bigger problems. This paper does the opposite - expanding the domain to encompass the whole world of physics.

# C++ `std::string_view` for better performance: An example use case

[Arthur O'Dwyer: `std::string_view` is a borrow type](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2018/03/27/string-view-is-a-borrow-type/)

> Borrow types are essentially “borrowed” references to existing objects. They lack ownership; they are short-lived; they generally can do without an assignment operator. They generally appear only in function parameter lists; because they lack ownership semantics, they generally cannot be stored in data structures or returned safely from functions.

# JSON Library from the makers of Boost.Beast

Vinnie Falcou:

> A survey of existing JSON libraries shows impressive diversity and features. However, no library is known to meet all of the design goals mentioned here. In particular, we know of no library that supports incremental parsing and serialization, and also supports custom allocators robustly.

```bash
