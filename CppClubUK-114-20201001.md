## The Defold game engine code style

[Article](https://defold.com/2020/05/31/The-Defold-engine-code-style/)

### Code style

* C-like C++
* No classes (_huh?_ -- _GD_)
* No exceptions
* No STL
  * Custom containers
* Data ownership tracking
* C++98

## Should I use C++ exceptions?

## C++17 Zero allocation Coroutine/[Resumable function] library

[GitHub](https://github.com/seppeon/SCoro)

This does not use C++20 coroutines. It is a managed state machine style coroutine library, a modern take on [Duff's device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device). This is supposed to work with C++17 compilers. Why, because C++20 coroutines:

* are difficult to develop with.
* make nested `co_await` clumsy and have large memory overhead to do it right.
* [HALO](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3368826.3377914) optimization seems to regularly fail.
* require heap allocation to be avaliable in the general case,making them unusable on many systems.

> I do not buy any of these anti-coroutine arguments (maybe except for the fact that HALO can fail in some situations -- but that is an engineering problem in the compiler).

## Library: cpp-lazy

* [GitHub](https://github.com/MarcDirven/cpp-lazy)

Cpp-lazy is a fast and easy lazy evaluation library for C++14/17/20.

Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy which holds the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed. In this library, all the iterators are lazy evaluated.

This library is not a replacement for `ranges::v3` but rather a (smaller) alternative.
