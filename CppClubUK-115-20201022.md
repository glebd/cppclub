## C++17 Zero allocation Coroutine/[Resumable function] library

[GitHub](https://github.com/seppeon/SCoro)

This does not use C++20 coroutines. It is a managed state machine style coroutine library, a modern take on [Duff's device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device).

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ikhlvw/c17_zero_allocation_coroutineresumable_function/)

> I do not buy any of these anti-coroutine arguments (maybe except for the fact that HALO can fail in some situations -- but that is an engineering problem in the compiler).

## Recursive lambdas in C++

[Philip Trettner](https://artificial-mind.net/blog/2020/09/12/recursive-lambdas)

```cpp
auto fib = [](int n, auto&& fib) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fib(n - 1, fib) + fib(n - 2, fib);
};
auto i = fib(7, fib);
```
