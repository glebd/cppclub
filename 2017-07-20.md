# Toronto report — Herb Sutter

https://herbsutter.com/2017/07/15/trip-report-summer-iso-c-standards-meeting-toronto/

* 120 people, 9 national bodies
* 1st meeting for C++20
* Concepts TS merged into draft C++20!
    - no “introducer syntax”
    - no “terse/natural syntax” for now (no consensus)
    - removed the need to write “bool”
    - removed function concepts "until we see a need to overload concepts"

# Toronto report — Herb Sutter

* Allow lambda capture `[=, this]`
* Add designated initializers. Draft C++20 now allows code like:

```cpp
struct A { int x; int y; int z; }; A b{.x = 1, .z = 2};
```

* Allow template parameter lists on lambdas:

```cpp
auto f = []<typename T>(std::vector<T> vector){/*…*/};
```

# Toronto report — Herb Sutter

* Coroutines TS
* Ranges TS
* Networking TS
* Modules PDTS (no macros)

Not yet:

* Concurrency TS (published, parts to be merged in the next meeting)

# Toronto report by Guy Davidson

I’ve read many trip reports but they tend to speak of the results more than the process. This post will describe more of the process.

* There is a wiki. Make sure you retrieve the URL and login details from another delegate.
* All the groups are different in attendance, character and operation. Try them out.
* wg21.link is your most useful tool.
* Volunteer for things. History is made by those who turn up.
* Everyone is a volunteer. Nobody is out to impress anybody.
* If you don’t know something, take this rare opportunity to learn from the designers.
* Sleep well, eat properly and stay hydrated. It’s easy to forget when you’re concentrating on other things.

# Toronto Meeting Discussion

Clang added option `-std=c++2a` for C++20.

# Deduction guides

* http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0702r0.html
* [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6ngkgc/2017_toronto_iso_c_committee_discussion_thread/dk9remg/)

Current:

```cpp
tuple t{tuple{1, 2}};   // Deduces tuple<int, int>
vector v{vector{1, 2}}; // Deduces vector<vector<int>>
```

C++20: prefer copy initialization

```cpp
vector a {vector {1, 2},
          vector {3, 4}}; // vector<vector<int>>
vector b {vector {1, 2}}; // vector<int>
```

# Networking TS

[Implementation by Chris Kohlhoff](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/networking-ts-impl)

> This implementation is automatically generated from the Asio library. Consequently, it may still be missing small pieces of functionality, or contain artifacts from Asio that are not part of the TS.
