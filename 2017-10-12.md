#Â More CppCon 2017 trip reports

* [Isabella Muerte](https://izzys.casa/posts/cppcon-2017-trip-report.html)
    * "I came to the conclusion that the Modules TS needs more scrutiny and is in dire need of fixing, or we're all going to regret it."
* [Jens Weller of Meeting C++](https://www.meetingcpp.com/blog/items/A-CppCon-2017-trip-report.html)
    * Highlights the differences between CppCon and Meeting C++
    * "Matt Gottbold" :-)

# Antoine TRAN TAN - Extending C++ with Co-Array semantics

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM8A8HUGwAY)

Co-arrays are a Fortran standard extension implementing Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model.

* SIMD
* PGAS
* Non-Uniform Memory Access ([NUMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access))
* Async programming

# Meta Stuff

> This is the code I use in my game for all serialization/deserialization/introspection stuff.

* Strongly typed and doesn't use RTTI or virtual functions in any way.
* No dependencies. You have to use modern C++ compiler which supports C++14, though. (VS 2015, GCC 5+, Clang 3.8)
* Serialization is not limited to any format.

# Ultra-fast Serialization of C++ Objects

# Transwarp

Transwarp is a header-only C++ library for task concurrency. It enables you to free your functors from explicit threads and transparently manage dependencies. Under the hood, a directed acyclic graph is built that allows for efficient traversal and type-safe dependencies. Use transwarp if you want to model your dependent operations in a graph of tasks and intend to invoke the graph more than once.
