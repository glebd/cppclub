# More CppCon 2017 trip reports

* [Isabella Muerte](https://izzys.casa/posts/cppcon-2017-trip-report.html)
    * "I came to the conclusion that the Modules TS needs more scrutiny and is in dire need of fixing, or we're all going to regret it."
* [Jens Weller of Meeting C++](https://www.meetingcpp.com/blog/items/A-CppCon-2017-trip-report.html)
    * Highlights the differences between CppCon and Meeting C++
    * "Matt Gottbold" :-)

# Antoine TRAN TAN - Extending C++ with Co-Array semantics

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM8A8HUGwAY)

Co-arrays are a Fortran standard extension implementing Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model.

* SIMD
* PGAS
* Non-Uniform Memory Access ([NUMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access))
* Async programming

# Kevlin Henney - Functional C++

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlkE8EJZODw)

* C++ is copy-based, Java is reference-based
* Const correctness
* Value types
* Builder pattern for value types
* Persistent data structures

# CppCon 2017: Stephen Dewhurst "Modern C++ Interfaces: Complexity, Emergent Simplicity, SFINAE, and Second Order Properties of Types"

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFdWqa68LmA)

* Excellent talk, highly recommended
* "Most good bugs are team efforts"
* `constexpr if` in C++17 + return type deduction in C++14 allows greater flexibility
* SFINAE

# In-place containers for fun and profit

[Blog post by David Gross](http://david-grs.github.io/inplace_containers_for_fun_and_profit/)

The idea behind `inplace_string` is to get a full replacement of C++17’s `std::string`, with an in-place memory storage.

The underlying container is `std::array<CharT, N>` and it uses the famous trick — made popular by [fbstring](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/FBString.md) — of storing the remaining size within the last byte of the string.

```cpp
using Name = inplace_string<15>;
// 16 bytes on stack, size included
Name name = "foo";
auto it = name.find("r");
assert(it == Name::npos);
name += "bar";
std::string str(name); // implicit string_view construction
```

# Meta Stuff

> This is the code I use in my game for all serialization/deserialization/introspection stuff.

* Strongly typed and doesn't use RTTI or virtual functions in any way.
* No dependencies. You have to use modern C++ compiler which supports C++14, though. (VS 2015, GCC 5+, Clang 3.8)
* Serialization is not limited to any format.

# Transwarp

Transwarp is a header-only C++ library for task concurrency. It enables you to free your functors from explicit threads and transparently manage dependencies. Under the hood, a directed acyclic graph is built that allows for efficient traversal and type-safe dependencies. Use transwarp if you want to model your dependent operations in a graph of tasks and intend to invoke the graph more than once (MIT).
