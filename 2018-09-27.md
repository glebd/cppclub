> \<This paper\> shows how to efficiently diagnose many common cases of dangling (use-after-free) in C++ code, using only local analysis to report them as deterministic readable errors at compile time.

# Non-Virtual Destructors, by Anders Knatten (CppQuiz)

[Post](https://blog.knatten.org/2018/03/02/non-virtual-destructors/)

§5.3.5/3 in the C++11 standard:

> If the static type of the object to be deleted is different from its dynamic type, the static type shall be a base class of the dynamic type of the object to be deleted and the static type shall have a virtual destructor or the behavior is undefined.
