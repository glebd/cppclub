# True parallelism, with no concept of threads - Alfred Bratterud - Meeting C++ 2017

Fibers, green threads, channels, lightweight processes, coroutines, pthreads - there are lots of options for parallelism abstractions. But what do you do if you just want your application to run a specific task on a specific core on your machine? In IncludeOS we have proper multicore support allowing you to do just that in C++: assign a task - for instance a lambda - directly to an available CPU. <...> In this talk weâ€™ll <...> explore how direct per-core processing can be combined with threading concepts like C++14 fibers or coroutines, without taking away from the simplicity of getting work done uninterrupted.

# True parallelism, with no concept of threads - Alfred Bratterud - Meeting C++ 2017 (cont.)

Conclusions:

* You don't need classical threads to utilize CPU cores
    * Fibers and coroutines can run directly on them
* A pthreads backend requires true blocking
    * Might require fibers, yielding directly to scheduler
* Coroutines TS beats the simplest stack switch
* Stackful coroutines would replace our fibers
* Expect more multicore magic from IncludeOS

# Ground Up Functional API Design in C++, by Sumant Tambe

* [Video: Systematic Generation of Data and Types in C++](https://vimeo.com/247642986) -- this talk presents two classic techniques from the functional domain -- composable data generators and property-based testing -- implemented in C++14 for testing a generic serialization and deserialization library ([RefleX](http://rticommunity.github.io/rticonnextdds-reflex/)). The talk describes the laws of monoids, functors, applicative, and monads and how they are implemented in a simple to understand abstraction of data generators.
