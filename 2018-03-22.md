# Jacksonville trip reports

* [Vittorio Romeo](https://vittorioromeo.info/index/blog/mar18_iso_meeting_report.html)
* [Guy Davidson](https://hatcat.com/?p=33)

The Plan (according to Herb Sutter):

* Executors: TS in the C++20 timeframe, standard in C++23
* Networking: C++23 (delayed by Executors)
* Coroutines: C++20
* Modules: Partially in C++20 with more in C++23 (blame Google)
* Contracts: C++20
* Reflection: TS in C++20 timeframe, standard in C++23
* Ranges: Core in C++20, cool stuff in C++23

# C++ committee, please look at the big picture

> More disappointment as the C++ standardisation process fails to deliver what programmers need....

> There have been a lot of improvements but the whole "It must be perfect" ethos rather than 80/20 is really damaging this language and libraries.

> Maybe the precious backwards compatibility is more damaging to progress?

# Memory Tagging (aka memory coloring, memory tainting, lock and key) and how it improves C/C++ memory safety

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1802/1802.09517.pdf)

* Every TG (tagging granularity) bytes of memory aligned by TG are associated with a tag of TS (tag size) bits. These TG bytes are called the granule.
* TS bits in the upper part of every pointer contain a tag.
* Memory allocation (e.g. malloc) chooses a tag, associates the memory chunk being
allocated with this tag, and sets this tag in the returned pointer.
* Every load and store instruction raises an exception on mismatch between the pointer and memory tags.
* The memory access and tag check do not necessarily occur atomically with respect to
each other.

# Memory Tagging (cont.)

Implementations:

* SPARC ADI: The SPARC ADI hardware extension is supported on SPARC M7/M8 CPUs running Solaris OS. There is also some indication that Linux support is in progress.
* AArch64 HWASAN (hardware-assisted ASAN): an AArch64-specific compiler-based tool.

# True parallelism, with no concept of threads - Alfred Bratterud - Meeting C++ 2017

Fibers, green threads, channels, lightweight processes, coroutines, pthreads - there are lots of options for parallelism abstractions. But what do you do if you just want your application to run a specific task on a specific core on your machine? In IncludeOS we have proper multicore support allowing you to do just that in C++: assign a task - for instance a lambda - directly to an available CPU. <...> In this talk we’ll <...> explore how direct per-core processing can be combined with threading concepts like C++14 fibers or coroutines, without taking away from the simplicity of getting work done uninterrupted.

# True parallelism, with no concept of threads - Alfred Bratterud - Meeting C++ 2017 (cont.)

Conclusions:

* You don't need classical threads to utilize CPU cores
    * Fibers and coroutines can run directly on them
* A pthreads backend requires true blocking
    * Might require fibers, yielding directly to scheduler
* Coroutines TS beats the simplest stack switch
* Stackful coroutines would replace our fibers
* Expect more multicore magic from IncludeOS

# Ground Up Functional API Design in C++, by Sumant Tambe

* [Article](https://cpptruths.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/ground-up-functional-api-design-in-c.html)
* [Video: Systematic Generation of Data and Types in C++](https://vimeo.com/247642986) -- this talk presents two classic techniques from the functional domain -- composable data generators and property-based testing -- implemented in C++14 for testing a generic serialization and deserialization library ([RefleX](http://rticommunity.github.io/rticonnextdds-reflex/)). The talk describes the laws of monoids, functors, applicative, and monads and how they are implemented in a simple to understand abstraction of data generators.
