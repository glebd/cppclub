# Visual C++ Team Blog - std::any: How, when, and why

[Post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/10/04/stdany-how-when-and-why/)

> When you need to store an object of an arbitrary type, pull std::any out of your toolbox. Be aware that there are probably more appropriate tools available when you do know something about the type to be stored.

# C++ Best Practices, by Jason Turner

[GitHub](https://github.com/lefticus/cppbestpractices/blob/master/00-Table_of_Contents.md)

# Library: SQLite ORM

* [Code](https://github.com/fnc12/sqlite_orm)
    - Licence: BSD-2-Clause
    - C++14

# Library: Inja - a template engine for modern C++

* [Code](https://github.com/pantor/inja)
    - Licence: MIT
    - Header-only
    - Uses NLohmann's [JSON library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases)
    - [Conan wrapper](https://github.com/DEGoodmanWilson/conan-inja)

```cpp
json data;
data["name"] = "world";
inja::render("Hello {{ name }}!", data); // Returns "Hello world!"
```

# Library: C++ REST SDK (formerly Casablanca) by Microsoft

* [Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk)
    - Licence: MIT
    - C++11
    - Supports Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android

> The C++ REST SDK is a Microsoft project for cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design. This project aims to help C++ developers connect to and interact with services.

# Library: Caffe2 - A New Lightweight, Modular, and Scalable Deep Learning Framework

* [Website](https://caffe2.ai/)
* [Code](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2)
    - Licence: Apache-2.0

# Tool: Superluminal profiler for Windows

[Website](https://www.superluminal.eu/)

* Combines sampling and instrumentation
* Visualizes thread communication flow
* Kernel-level callstacks
* Dynamic filtering of areas of interest
* High frequency sampling (8 KHz)
* Timeline view, call graph, source view
* 7-day free trial, then EUR 99/149/289

# Conan, vcpkg or build2?

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9m4l0p/conan_vcpkg_or_build2/)

* Pragmatic choice: vcpkg or Conan (they work today and are complete enough)
* Pragmatic no-brainer choice: vcpkg (it's the simplest and it have more packages ready)
* Pragmatic but need finer control choice: Conan (it gives more options)
* (Very) Long term choice: Build2 (shows great promises because it uses a coherent model...)
* Ideal choice (from the future): help SG15 (the group reflecting on tools vs C++) define interfaces for build systems and dependency managers so that your choice is not impacted by your dependencies choices.
