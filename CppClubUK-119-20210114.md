## Reverse Engineering the source code of the BioNTech/Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine

Not strictly C++ related, but fascinating nevertheless, and also topical.

### CoSy - Computing Systems Technology Conference

* [Website](https://soasis.org/cosy/)

CoSy (pronounced like "cozy") is a Systems Programming Conference:

* Broad scope (C++, C, Rust, Zig, FORTH, Nim, OCaml etc.)
* Double-blind submission reviews

> Of course, it’s not always possible to double-blind everything! If someone writes a submission about how they wrote a Great Book On Large Scale Software Architecture That’s Really Good And Helps You Modularize And Structure Large Software And The Sequel Is Out You Should Buy It Now, they have vastly reduced the pool of people they could be talking about.

## FTL - A functional template library for containers processing in C++

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ftlorg/ftl)
  * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jor2hd/ftl_a_functional_template_library_for_containers/)

FTL is a C++17-based library that provides a more convenient API for collections processing. The API is heavily inspired by the Rust programming language.

```cpp
const auto totalVolume = cityTrees.iter()
  .filter([](const auto &tree) { return tree.kind == Tree::Oak && tree.diameter > 25; })
  .map([](const auto &tree) { return tree.volume(); })
  .sum();
```
