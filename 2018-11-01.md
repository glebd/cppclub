# Standard Library Algorithms: Changes and Additions in C++17

# Who is STL? I mean the person, not the library

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9mwtcm/who_is_stl_i_mean_the_person_not_the_library/)

> Hey. I’m Stephan T. Lavavej (“Steh-fin Lah-wah-wade”), and I’ve worked on MSVC’s STL since 2007. I’ve also worked on several Standard proposals that were accepted (notably the transparent operator functors). I filmed a bunch of videos for MS’s Channel 9 years ago, introducing various Core Language and Standard Library topics, and I’ve given talks at C++Now (formerly BoostCon) and CppCon which have been recorded.

# Visual C++ Team Blog - std::any: How, when, and why

[Post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/10/04/stdany-how-when-and-why/)

> When you need to store an object of an arbitrary type, pull std::any out of your toolbox. Be aware that there are probably more appropriate tools available when you do know something about the type to be stored.

# C++ Best Practices, by Jason Turner

```cpp
json data;
data["name"] = "world";
inja::render("Hello {{ name }}!", data); // Returns "Hello world!"
```

# Conan, vcpkg or build2?

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/9m4l0p/conan_vcpkg_or_build2/)

* Pragmatic choice: vcpkg or Conan (they work today and are complete enough)
* Pragmatic no-brainer choice: vcpkg (it's the simplest and it have more packages ready)
* Pragmatic but need finer control choice: Conan (it gives more options)
* (Very) Long term choice: Build2 (shows great promises because it uses a coherent model...)
* Ideal choice (from the future): help SG15 (the group reflecting on tools vs C++) define interfaces for build systems and dependency managers so that your choice is not impacted by your dependencies choices.
