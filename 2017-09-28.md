# C++17 in Visual Studio

[Stephan T. Lavavej on Twitter](https://twitter.com/StephanTLavavej/status/912828909246234624):

> C++17 fold expressions have been implemented by @joncaves for VS 2017 15.5!

And [later](https://twitter.com/StephanTLavavej/status/912937233463754752):

> Our plan was C++17 complete in calendar year 2017. It looks like we’ll miss that, but we’re getting really close. FS will be last in libs.

# Google's Abseil

[Abseil](https://abseil.io) is an open-source collection of C++ library code designed to augment the C++ standard library. The Abseil library code is collected from Google’s own C++ code base, has been extensively tested and used in production, and is the same code we depend on in our daily coding lives.

In some cases, Abseil provides pieces missing from the C++ standard; in others, Abseil provides alternatives to the standard for special needs we’ve found through usage in the Google code base. We denote those cases clearly within the library code we provide you.

// more complex implicit conversion
meters_per_second_t speed = 60_mi / 1_hr;
// previous example with mixed units
square_meter_t      area  = 15_m * 5_m + 1000_cm * 1000_cm;

# static_any: a low-latency stack-based Boost.Any

[Article](http://david-grs.github.io/low_latency_stack_based_boost_any/), [GitHub](https://github.com/david-grs/static_any) (MIT)

A container for generic (as general) data type like `boost.any`. However:

* It is ~10x faster than `boost.any`, mainly because there is no memory allocation
* As it lies on the stack, it is cache-friendly, close to your other class attributes
* There is a very small space overhead: a fixed overhead of 8 bytes

# Orbit Profiler

Orbit is a standalone profiler and debugging tool for Windows. Its main purpose is to help developers understand and visualize the execution flow of a complex application. By giving a bird’s eye view of what is happening under the hood, Orbit gives the developer a deeper understanding of complex systems and allows to quickly find performance bottlenecks.
