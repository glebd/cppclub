# Your own type predicate in C++11

[Post](https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/your-own-type-predicate/)

A gentle intro to metaprogramming, metafunctions and type traits.

```cpp
static_assert(is_acceptable<X>::value,
              "X does not have a desired interface");

template <typename... T>
using void_t = void;
```

# std::launder - Réka Kovács - Lightning Talks Meeting C++ 2017

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXCbLilIzs)

```cpp
#include <new>
struct X { const int n; double m; }
int main() {
    X p{3, 8.8};
    new (&p) X{5, 7.7};
    int b = std::launder(&p)->n; // 5
    double c = p.m; // UB!
}
```

# Callbacks in C++

* Function pointer
* Pointer to member function
* Functor
* Lambda

# Stiffstream C++ libraries

* [SObjectizer](https://stiffstream.com/en/products/sobjectizer.html) -- a framework for building solid multithreaded applications. It is based on async message exchange and uses a mixture high-level abstractions: Actor-Model, Publish-Subscribe and Communicating Sequential Processes.
* [RESTinio](https://stiffstream.com/en/products/restinio.html) --  header-only C++14 library that gives you an embedded HTTP server with nice express-like routing (although it is not mandatory to use router) and websockets on board.
* [timertt](https://sourceforge.net/p/sobjectizer/wiki/Timer%20Thread%20Template/) -- The timertt (Timer Thread Template) library was created as a lightweight alternative of ACE Framework's timers for SObjectizer.

Jon Purdy @whyevernotso:

> People who deeply understand C++ are great to have on a team---not for their knowledge of C++, but for their ability to accept, cope with, and pragmatically manage things that other people would balk at and call insane, bug-prone, abject horrors.

Slava Pestov @slava_pestov, Apple Swift programmer:

> This is very true, but there are like five people who deeply understand C++
