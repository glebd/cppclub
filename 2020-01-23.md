* [Specification](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/?force=1&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vector-of-bool/libman/develop/data/spec.bs)

**libman** is a new level of indirection between package management and build systems.

**dds** is Drop-Dead Simple build and package manager.

# Book: C++ Move Semantics - The Complete Guide, by Nicolai Josuttis

* [Website](http://www.cppmove.com)

> Move semantics, introduced with C++11, has become a hallmark of modern C++ programming. However, it also complicates the language in many ways. Even after several years of support of move semantics experienced programmers struggle with all the details of move semantics. And style guides still don't recommend the right consequences for programming even of trivial classes.
